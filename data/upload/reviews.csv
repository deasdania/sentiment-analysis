941,2,3266,5,A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation
942,2,3665,5,I really enjoy my Fire stick. It's really easy to use.
943,2,2944,5,Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k.
944,2,2232,5,Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms.
765,23,3157,5,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale."
489,23,3797,4,It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube
1360,20,2563,5,My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.
379,23,977,5,Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.
1371,20,3750,5,Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does.
634,23,3785,4,Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial
793,23,3019,4,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too."
1479,20,2414,5,The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted
743,23,13,5,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.
270,23,3516,5,I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home
507,23,243,3,It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn’t play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services
3026,11,1589,3,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. "
882,23,452,5,The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.
3180,11,3748,5,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music
3010,11,2230,5,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great."
172,23,737,4,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible
1108,20,824,4,"I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn't do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus."
252,23,1860,3,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out."
1269,20,3480,5,my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present
754,23,3771,5,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better
123,23,2489,4,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house."
1274,20,791,5,"Easy to set up, easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great!"
521,23,3039,3,Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone
1165,20,3680,5,Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.
1352,20,2370,5,Fun item and helpful to do things around the home.
929,23,1735,5,"Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item."
1515,20,1297,5,Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home.
1081,20,3165,4,The Amazon - Echo Plus is good buy it buy it you will love it
1389,20,2616,4,"Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google's, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints."
1036,20,3315,4,Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great.
3003,11,513,5,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase."
1244,20,3608,5,Sound quality is very good & Sleek design is nice.
849,23,1760,5,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!"
1083,20,3199,5,We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning
922,23,3522,5,"Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc."
321,23,1022,5,"Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more!"
408,23,1829,5,Great accessory for Alexis system..helpful and fun
604,23,1689,5,I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product
1421,20,278,5,We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she‚Äôs been great!
991,20,2476,4,I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as ‚ÄúAlexa turn off lights in bedroom‚Äù . Overall she‚Äôs amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events
983,20,356,5,"bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts."
631,23,2600,3,"The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement"
531,23,2218,5,A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.
1268,20,771,5,Definitely worth the money. The sound is awesome!!
658,23,1797,4,"Yes, it’s a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I’m hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though."
841,23,1303,5,I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.
623,23,1160,5,I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.
1218,20,3249,5,great sound. Love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it.
323,23,701,5,"Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa."
866,23,3346,3,"We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun"
288,23,118,5,This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated!
1216,20,579,5,"This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more."
1519,20,2723,4,"The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though."
615,23,2539,5,"The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo."
1177,20,1414,4,"Speaker has great sound and it’s awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasnt too sure of, but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more. It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub."
608,23,2817,5,"Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them."
701,23,68,5,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!
232,23,2095,5,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!"
930,23,785,5,I recommended is very good and practice. Play music is very good quality speaker I see video. I love
1370,20,1479,5,No issues perfect works as advertised........................
3035,11,1556,5,Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.
713,23,3769,5,Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about
498,23,75,5,I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one.
1279,20,629,5,Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house.
610,23,2166,4,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking."
899,23,2373,5,The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echos. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.
585,23,1153,5,Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome
485,23,30,5,A great addition to our home. Kids love it and is vary helpful
1483,20,2035,5,Got it as a Christmas gift and I love it! I would recommend this product.
482,23,2370,5,Bought this for my mom. She thinks it's great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items.
1148,20,1378,5,"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs."
451,23,2024,5,Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things.
3200,11,3696,5,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.
730,23,2638,5,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.
1495,20,2087,5,"This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus. It can be turned on and off and also dimmed. The echo Plus is amazing - can play music, control TV and answer many questions."
3130,11,3468,5,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR"
684,23,2645,5,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home."
351,23,3411,5,"This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs"
456,23,3104,5,I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it.
142,23,3390,5,I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product
881,23,90,5,The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!
1451,20,2552,5,"The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha"
1112,20,3737,4,This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product
908,23,3519,5,Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family
3146,11,2197,4,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
346,23,2155,5,Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.
903,23,3132,4,"This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter! If you have Alexa an you like it, a must have upgrade."
1176,20,3254,5,This is a very neat item. Love all the things this can do!
392,23,3365,4,Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy
1286,20,2349,5,"I am so glad that I bought this Echo, it has made it easier to automate my music, and my lights throughout my house. We are still learning to use it, but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items I can control with my Alexa."
3104,11,207,5,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.
681,23,1888,5,As advertised......................................
751,23,108,5,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!
1262,20,424,5,"received as a Christmas gift. really works well, we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone, so you don't need to remember to plug in a timer when going away. plays amazon music and sound is amazing"
433,23,528,5,I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done
1328,20,3237,5,I love this product would really recommend to any one!
322,23,2201,5,"Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report"
1030,20,3,5,"Love the sound, I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo"
1529,20,899,5,"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs."
733,23,3687,4,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product."
3151,11,1651,4,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.
2987,11,415,5,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.
1526,20,1481,5,My first Alexa product and I’m going to say I’ve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome
1472,20,864,5,I love my Echo Plus!! The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition!!
1070,20,1836,5,Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present
139,23,294,4,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights..."
690,23,670,5,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc."
1293,20,2383,3,When I tried to hook it up it wouldn't recognize my internet. I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working
1312,20,877,5,"As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes."
248,23,2029,5,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!"
1531,20,931,4,Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings
818,23,2790,5,"I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless."
458,23,1941,5,I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.
960,20,1653,3,"I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked."
811,23,981,5,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.
290,23,3793,4,I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next.
439,23,534,5,"Have not set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better!"
460,23,2071,5,"This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy"
227,23,3044,5,Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information
1517,20,605,5,"Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit."
1151,20,1607,4,Great product. Didnt realize its compatible with different items
3158,11,1391,5,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy
1388,20,1710,4,Nice addition to the home but not essential
3037,11,175,4,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.
294,23,2991,5,"I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself."
236,23,3730,5,"If youre like me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door"
196,23,738,5,This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature
890,23,2550,4,Great product will recommend it to friends and family.
688,23,3246,4,Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product
928,23,2834,5,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :)
1368,20,1525,4,Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times
766,23,2833,5,Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!
1530,20,3466,5,Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice
892,23,1903,5,The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away
228,23,525,5,I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!!
830,23,1374,4,"a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen!"
555,23,811,5,"Bought for my 88 year old Mom, she loves it, help her with recipes and cooking."
238,23,3138,3,Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated
1048,20,226,5,"Love my Echo Plus, echo, echo spot and Ech show. Very satisfied with the products. They work great individually or with each other."
1237,20,3364,5,This will be a great gift for the whole house too enjoy.
3153,11,128,5,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.
1017,20,3014,5,Love my Alexa! Having lots of fun asking her questions and enjoy listening to music on it.
437,23,3325,5,"Great video quality, sound/music from a rather small device. Seems well made, entertaining, and more functional as we learn its many features."
416,23,397,4,"I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this. We also love being able to listen to music, world news, search for items or products and easily order items from this device. We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home. It does so much more. I think this is a great device for the home."
591,23,1068,5,I’ve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made.
3198,11,620,5,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!
736,23,40,4,I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information
557,23,524,5,This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display.
784,23,1741,5,Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.
670,23,1377,4,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing."
935,23,226,4,"I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven't tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good."
431,23,1241,5,My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself! So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices. I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell.
180,23,285,5,I purchased this for my children who are separated by miles. Can't wait for them to open their gifts
1258,20,1921,5,This is the best...fast to play music and check weather and lots of other questions
693,23,331,4,"FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
606,23,2144,5,Amazing. Voice recognition great at long distances. Amazon music great! Cant say enough good!
1301,20,3031,5,I didnt know what I was missing out on until I got an Echo Plus
1486,20,2437,5,Works great! Just the beginning of my plans for a smart house!
3163,11,95,5,Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!
1532,20,1087,5,Alexa rocks. The Echo Plus is super easy to set up. I works great. Love everything about it. Adding more devices.
578,23,221,5,"I knew this item would be great, but the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations."
1469,20,291,5,I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products.
382,23,3541,4,We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesnt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me.
1295,20,374,5,Set up was simple. We liked so much we bought one for my Mom
1419,20,2437,5,i was weary about it at first but it was easy to setup and get the hang of and definitely makes life easier!
764,23,542,4,I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.
3097,11,3479,3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
466,23,903,3,"The device works well mechanically, however, the software needs a lot of work. Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized."
3073,11,1063,5,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem."
948,20,3391,5,"Love the convenience of being able to turn on a light or other appliances connected to smart switches with voice commands. Also very convenient music streaming, news and weather reports."
955,20,884,5,Love it. Its a lot of fun. Great speakers too provides a lot of great information and fun too!
947,20,17,5,"So I went to the store, purchased and gifted.it was a snap."
1229,20,2511,3,"It works well and sounds decent, but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as Samsung."
1426,20,1039,5,"This is a neat little toy. Its pretty cool that Im able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa."
479,23,2257,5,I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff
1127,20,1921,4,We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone. We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns on/off.
407,23,3050,4,$150 is a good price for this Alexa with a screen.
1459,20,3601,5,having an assistant like Echo makes life so much easier
3067,11,555,5,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.
1397,20,1717,5,I love my Amazon Echo! Alexa is compatible with all of my technology and super easy to use. My favorite is the ease of making a grocery list and having it in the app instead of forgetting my list at home.
160,23,3145,4,Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub.
167,23,3688,4,We really like that when you call someone you can FaceTime with them!
970,20,1685,5,I will definitely recommend this product . The tech support is also easy and friendly. Alexa keeps my husband company during the day answering his questions.
1343,20,2741,5,I have been greatly impressed with the Alexa. A friend loves calling me and asking her Alexa questions. We share alot of laughs just discovering all the things she can do. So I just had to purchase an Alexa for myself. I'm just beginning set my Alexa up. I hope it's easy because I'm not tech. salve. I've got to go and get started with the set-up.
1255,20,44,5,Bought this for my parents to use with their Amazon prime account. Sure they will love it.
1467,20,2178,5,This is one of Good item bought for my 2017 Thanksgiving deals
3006,11,3376,5,"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him"
3186,11,187,5,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
1050,20,1480,5,Great product. Works as advertised and fun to use.
791,23,1534,5,Ive always loved the amazon Alexa smart products and use them to control my smart home setup.
1496,20,1943,4,"The Echo Plus is great. Alexa is the best feature. The only problem is, you cant use it wirelessly. It must remain plugged in at all times, which is kind of annoying."
747,23,1889,5,Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
136,23,2168,4,"Awesome sound which was unexpected. It's nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes, song lyrics, weather, etc."
1249,20,1102,5,The Echo Plus is an Awesome Device. Lots of information just by speech.
1089,20,3472,5,Purchased as a gift for the family. Cant wait to use it.
1448,20,3318,3,Now that now how to set it up I love my alexia lights
381,23,3079,5,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.
1078,20,1446,5,Alexa turns on the lights and when I say Alexa good night she turns them off. Love her!
502,23,3753,5,"I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phone.They loved it, and feel safer with it. I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help. Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion."
105,23,3128,4,This device is awesome ‚ really lets you get very excited about smart home technology  Im buying a second one for my upstairs
1008,20,558,4,"I take 1 star off, because I had problems to syncing it with my W-FI."
1072,20,3531,3,It is an ok device but I find Google home to be better and more promising in the future
3179,11,3231,5,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.
1079,20,589,5,Got this as a present for my fiance for Christmas will update
310,23,227,5,My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store
3009,11,2469,5,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!
203,23,3814,5,"This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. Its not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired."
3117,11,2531,5,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality
1387,20,1706,5,I love Alexa. Has a pretty good speaker for listening toMusic and helps with my shopping lists.
1150,20,3451,4,The first one was not working so we had to take it back and get a new one
459,23,856,4,This product worked very well and very easy to use.
281,23,954,4,"Bought this for a Christmas gift, so haven't actually seen this in action yet. Checked other reviews and they were good, and Best Buy had an awesome Black Friday price."
1013,20,3722,5,I love having Alexa in my home. Alexa has helped from recipes to relaxing sleep sounds all night
647,23,220,4,Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product
508,23,1788,5,Love this thing. Little apprehensive at first. But Alexa will grow on you
1099,20,1208,4,Works great with WeMo and Philips Hue. Great sound and voice recognition.
237,23,672,5,he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras.
697,23,1081,4,"So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about."
3175,11,3217,5,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.
3098,11,2678,5,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too."
888,23,938,4,Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos
1403,20,3595,5,Having fun with all the things we can learn from Alexa! It is almost like having another person in the house!
183,23,3600,4,I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa
3210,11,1524,4,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess."
1205,20,2123,5,I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home
600,23,3727,5,Great product that a whole family would enjoy. Its a perfect addition to the household.
1280,20,3206,5,"Decent sounding music device...easy to connect and use the app. Getting custom routines set up with smart home (vivint, hue, etc) takes some trial and error figuring out commands. Would buy again."
1080,20,1353,5,"I enjoy Alexa, she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive."
336,23,1064,4,"Fun and useful, very interactive and still learning all abilities."
522,23,1361,5,Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!!
958,20,3786,5,Alexa walks you through every step which I found helpful.
378,23,1843,5,Its an awesome item. Me and the kids love it.
3207,11,947,5,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking."
1408,20,2374,5,"Bought for mother, she loves it! Good price, in stock, and an easy purchase."
3137,11,3045,5,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where
820,23,955,5,"This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking."
3204,11,610,5,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.
3162,11,226,4,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
1234,20,3738,5,"Seamlessly control your house, tell Alexa to turn on your favorite music, and play games. Not much else you could ask for, especially for the price!"
783,23,2574,5,Love the screen and being able to see video along with my cameras on my Vivint smart home
1062,20,1479,5,Since installing the Amazon Echo we have been having fun with talking to Alexa. Also the music feature is great
176,23,3450,4,we enjoy asking it questions about history & educational stuff for kids.
737,23,1318,5,Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon. Now my fam is all connected.
1411,20,442,5,"The Alexa works well and turns my lights on and off for me in bed, and plays my playlist for when I sleep. Very nice for the bedroom."
586,23,2547,4,Love our Echo show. A few enhancements wed like to see in future such as ability to load multiple pictures instead of single photo. Can use Amazon photo but we do not prescribe.
1183,20,3760,5,"Echo Plus has everything the old Echo had, plus better sound and built-in capability for Smart Home add-ons, like Hue bulbs and SmartThings plugs ‚Äî without needing a Hue hub or ST hub. Love it!"
1026,20,3176,5,Great Echo!! Friend really liked it!! It really does what he wants it to do and he connected his lights to the device. Everything works well.
453,23,2904,5,i loved this product so much i have bought four of them for christmas gifts
287,23,2984,4,purchased for a capstone team to test and review how it would benefit today's journalist.
1230,20,2129,5,"This was a gift that I gave to my daughter at our family Christmas party. She loves it, especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights & her nest thermostat. This has also gone over well with the Grand Children."
1121,20,2467,5,"We finally decided to try the Echo system, after months and months of debate. We purchased the Echo Plus & an Echo Dot. The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs. The Plus's speakers are incredible for its size. We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus."
1160,20,2972,5,"Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me. This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely. Love my Alexa, and love the hue bulb. Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!!"
876,23,3664,4,"I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future."
2995,11,2198,5,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn."
1052,20,3728,5,"great for the elderly, makes life a lot easier for everyone"
212,23,346,4,"We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well."
3004,11,2283,4,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.
1164,20,1334,5,Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights.
261,23,2289,5,I love it.. easy to use. Many different features...
280,23,2241,4,"If you keep asking it to do things, you will be surprised at how much it can do"
3066,11,2412,5,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all
572,23,2946,5,I love all my Alexa's I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show. Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family.
750,23,3015,5,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!"
3045,11,3309,5,Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!
547,23,1348,4,Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound.
1162,20,1732,4,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but Ive read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.
3027,11,2809,5,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-"
178,23,2903,5,I have the echo and a dot. This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house. Use it every day. I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music.
1194,20,1055,4,"Great product, easier set up than anticipated. Actually bought for my Mother - she loves it."
208,23,748,5,I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers.
1251,20,1469,3,Very helpful for someone with disabilities. Saves a lot steps.Responsive and fun to use.
367,23,1831,5,It's nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too.
377,23,2463,5,"Love the ability to video chat with grand kids, Enjoying the music everyday."
1331,20,2817,5,This may be an incremental upgrade to the original Amazon Echo but is definitely worth it. Miles ahead from Google Home.
1124,20,2544,5,Smart Home=Happy Home!This lightbulb is simple...all you need to do is speak to it
1139,20,3355,4,Great Christmas gift! The hubby loved it . Just read the manual before setting up!!
798,23,1930,5,"I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE"
668,23,581,5,The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless.
3139,11,2611,5,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.
1201,20,1726,4,Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo.
1317,20,648,5,Love operation of this system.Bought the mini afterwards for another room.
243,23,1386,5,"I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon......"
170,23,3121,5,"I find myself saying to my phone, Alexa, play.......… I wish they made it for my car too."
402,23,2252,5,"Was debating on the purchase but looked very cool ,good quality video chat is clear"
1198,20,2710,4,You need to have Amazone prime in order to have music
165,23,3675,5,Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom.
672,23,2200,5,Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights
189,23,767,5,Great product. Easy to use .very easy to set up ..
324,23,562,4,"I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It's very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts."
1303,20,3289,5,"Ive been hesitant to purchase this item, didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need. Alexa has changed my mind. I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances, checking weather and adjusting my heat. Alexa can even arm the alarm system."
3143,11,3290,5,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.
386,23,1108,5,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home."
3057,11,280,5,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate
3012,11,3134,4,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.
627,23,1284,5,I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.
229,23,2051,2,It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.
3055,11,3016,4,Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.
216,23,1913,5,This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it.
1130,20,960,5,"This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly!"
199,23,1444,5,For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside smart alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!
1085,20,3345,5,Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door. Arming and disarming my security system. If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus
3046,11,2806,5,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!"
579,23,1349,5,Alexa has changed my life. I now own 3 Alexas. O
1325,20,1256,5,We love the new Echo! So easy to set up and use!!!
660,23,3176,5,Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products
659,23,3425,5,Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well.
836,23,342,4,"The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other."
921,23,2709,5,I love this thing! Its so fun and easy to use. My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack
1037,20,3533,5,"I have no idea how my family ever lived without these products! Since purchasing the Alexa Hub and Hue bulb, we've purchased Echo Dots for our kitchen and son's room. We absolutely love the convenience of the bulbs and Alexa is a life saver on so many levels."
1024,20,1910,5,I have had the competitive products and nothing compares.
1193,20,2217,5,"Alexa is fun to play with for the whole family, and it fills the house with music when not telling us a joke."
910,23,1491,5,I love my Alexa Show. It can answer most of my questions and I use it for recipes and listening to music. I use it everyday.
911,23,2054,5,The screen is a great upgrade. Music lyrics are displayed with good quality speakers. Very convenient for recipes and you can make hands free calls with great audio quality. Great product!
4254,1,1613,3,Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
4586,1,3067,5,Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle
2236,9,3280,4,Reminded my son and I of his old early generation Kindle that worked so well.
4582,1,2773,5,So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
3345,21,1782,5,this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...
4424,1,567,4,I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
4416,1,2908,4,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
4426,1,3638,5,"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy."
70,19,2570,1,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.
4701,12,3428,4,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it."
4702,12,2819,5,As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.
4340,1,1906,3,It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
4360,1,2437,4,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
3374,21,2969,4,"Really like the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my Ipad!."
3348,21,2181,3,Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.
2249,9,1251,4,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
4349,1,1071,1,Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.
4376,1,2299,5,"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
3415,21,2158,5,Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.
4455,1,926,5,"read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased"
4384,1,3612,5,I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
4256,1,2083,4,It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
4699,12,2873,5,The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!
4324,1,3507,4,We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
3372,21,202,5,"Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun..."
2349,9,3605,4,"Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight"
2435,9,2330,2,it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark
18,19,2902,5,Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good
2887,9,3120,5,Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.
4563,1,3656,5,"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
4585,1,1590,4,This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to.
3306,17,2466,5,Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
47,19,3726,5,"Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it."
2284,9,2171,5,"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
2623,9,2781,4,"I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome"
4235,1,398,5,I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
4274,1,199,4,It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
4434,1,3452,5,This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!
4657,1,1568,5,"This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy."
4469,1,2086,4,"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
4795,18,167,1,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with
4496,1,3329,5,We've had this tablet for about a month and have no complaints. Great tablet for a kid with lots of storage for games!
4242,1,1049,5,I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!
2525,9,732,5,I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good.
3382,21,186,5,Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly
4402,1,830,5,The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.
4264,1,3613,2,"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
3385,21,3205,5,"I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly."
3418,21,2473,5,"It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks."
4624,1,2607,5,Gave this to my son so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
4668,1,3258,5,"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.."
4495,1,1675,5,"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
4609,1,2107,5,"Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy"
4793,18,3814,5,"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against."
4226,1,3678,5,"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
2956,9,154,4,I purchased this Kindle for my daughter and she really enjoys using it !!
3403,21,630,4,"I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own."
56,19,263,5,the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library
4270,1,3257,3,"Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."
3303,17,59,5,"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!"
3356,21,2566,5,Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.
4622,1,3078,5,I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage.
3381,21,1880,5,Love this kindle - the press side page turner is great.
3402,21,776,5,Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it.
4559,1,3088,4,Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
2643,9,3742,5,Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.
4477,1,3253,5,The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.
1830,9,2524,5,It very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or
1896,9,3388,4,I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
4651,1,3727,5,The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
4401,1,2004,5,This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show.
2465,9,716,5,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models."
2929,9,1110,5,very good product and service will refer a friend.
95,19,3281,5,This was purchased as a gift and they've absolutely loved it.
4286,1,3197,5,This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate
4399,1,324,3,"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
1739,9,1419,5,I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.
4346,1,3205,5,"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
4406,1,2814,5,I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
4786,18,1884,5,lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle
4670,1,3751,5,"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
89,19,1369,5,Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.
3414,21,2149,4,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand."
4641,1,2517,4,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
4313,1,2753,3,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
4435,1,1962,5,"I love this tablet,I use it for school readings ,for my philosophy class , my Mac book is to delicate to take to school,but my fire tablet is perfect !"
4358,1,2742,5,I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
4693,12,876,4,"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light"
4542,1,2430,4,"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it."
4305,1,244,5,So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
4511,1,3635,5,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
3413,21,1056,5,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hard off the unit.
4652,1,544,4,I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
1964,9,3167,5,The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.
4506,1,3772,5,"Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!"
1571,9,1078,5,My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.
4705,12,898,5,Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature.
2228,9,1132,5,"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time."
4573,1,2204,5,"Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
68,19,3306,5,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.
4576,1,3614,5,Got this tablet cheap than getting the screen replaced
4700,12,2889,5,"I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool"
3226,17,2893,5,"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
4307,1,2919,5,I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
3231,17,2714,5,The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
4331,1,2739,5,Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
66,19,1401,5,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up."
4345,1,1738,5,"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
4770,18,621,5,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
2916,9,980,5,Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM
86,19,1946,5,Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where
4281,1,3703,5,"The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It's screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket."
4431,1,3571,5,"For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to!"
4220,1,344,5,This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!
4535,1,2282,5,I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
4425,1,2780,5,I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
4383,1,512,5,I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
4672,1,2592,5,I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.
4245,1,2023,5,"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
73,19,1779,5,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places."
2716,9,2145,4,"I like this ereader. It is a little small, but you can increase the font."
4427,1,3381,5,Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
2549,9,302,5,I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.
3391,21,1579,5,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.
3411,21,1757,5,"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent."
4366,1,354,4,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
3422,21,3628,5,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it."
4679,1,1959,5,"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
4538,1,2420,4,Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
4243,1,1366,4,"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
4489,1,3300,4,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
4627,1,3456,5,I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.
1833,9,269,4,"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
4566,1,350,5,Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
4318,1,2639,5,Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
4410,1,3591,5,My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
2811,9,3526,5,"It is so easy to use it is super light, and makes a book to read with no effort at all!"
4632,1,3427,4,My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
4222,1,2482,2,I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
87,19,2695,4,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two."
2369,9,643,5,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
9,19,2849,5,"It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though."
17,19,3526,4,Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
4266,1,3176,5,Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
4488,1,2438,5,Does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price.
69,19,3714,4,Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.
1967,9,338,3,"Very small in size, not exactly what I had thought but yet good product for the price I paid"
4348,1,2111,5,Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems
4767,18,2330,5,The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case
45,19,2171,5,"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
4458,1,2684,5,"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
2136,9,3048,4,"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light."
3307,17,3727,4,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
4365,1,1693,5,Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great.
4490,1,2636,5,I love it! I'm a senior and was able to set it up and get library books without help.
1723,9,758,5,This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.
72,19,880,3,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
4531,1,1012,4,Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
3353,21,2514,5,This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.
4481,1,2150,5,Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.

2701,9,3526,4,Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
4351,1,3131,5,Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
1535,3,3505,5,I needed a second charger (for traveling) for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger. This worked great. It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours.
1536,3,1468,5,This solved the problem of my daughter's lost kindle charger.
1537,3,1938,5,I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable.
1538,3,2898,5,Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
1539,3,1912,5,I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly!
1540,3,226,5,Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!
1541,3,2543,3,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/
1542,3,2307,5,"Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up."
1543,3,3216,5,Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package
1544,3,2677,5,just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
1545,3,583,5,Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
1546,3,1290,5,"This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily"
1547,3,1750,5,Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone.
1548,3,3622,5,Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.
1549,3,708,5,"After purchasing 2 different ""brand X"" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price!"
1550,3,2327,5,Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1551,3,3363,5,got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire
1552,3,1729,5,Love this base for charging my kindle. You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge. With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes.
1553,3,3099,5,Exactly what I needed. Didn't want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn't have to.
1554,3,3485,5,Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great.
1555,3,1025,5,"Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger."
1556,3,496,4,"pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
2800,8,3599,5,Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
4019,20,2757,5,I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.
3778,20,977,5,"I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad!"
2368,7,1166,5,"I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile."
4912,19,302,4,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
2414,7,1691,4,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
1636,2,3206,5,It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.
4999,19,764,5,"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.."
3708,20,2954,5,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
3791,20,1025,5,I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
4722,1,253,5,"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
3258,4,356,5,I love this product it is so easy to use It has a clear picture
2666,7,29,5,Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.
2213,2,1233,5,I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.
4719,1,3582,5,I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
4998,19,1953,5,"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
4039,20,3005,4,"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
3660,20,1798,5,I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
2679,2,2592,2,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
3924,20,591,5,"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
3249,4,1938,5,"I had reviewed and looked at this Samsung 65"" 4k HDTV and at this timeit was the best for the money..Very satisfied with TV and would recommend it to anyone."
3813,20,1350,5,"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
2316,2,2237,5,Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
4802,17,2281,5,Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
1749,7,1804,5,This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
3937,20,2596,4,This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
3862,20,3183,5,"I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
3215,4,2009,5,I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus
2309,8,862,4,"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet."
1868,8,1455,5,I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
1886,2,299,4,My son just loves it and he thinks it's easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it
1869,2,2464,5,My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they're a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!!
3659,20,2243,5,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it.
2673,8,2000,5,My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
1940,8,2874,5,I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage.
1638,2,3247,4,she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
4820,17,3445,5,"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
3896,20,2515,4,One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
2965,5,2040,4,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
3647,20,2018,5,"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
4135,20,596,5,"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
4861,17,2388,5,"Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
2016,7,1190,4,The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.
2531,8,1730,4,Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
3604,20,1,5,I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
2898,8,1872,4,I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
2731,8,1043,5,It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
1582,7,3569,5,Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
3861,20,2182,4,This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books
4213,20,3122,5,"Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games."
2645,8,1845,5,Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use
3689,20,1018,5,love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.

4032,20,469,4,"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
4919,19,157,5,Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
2125,5,3399,4,I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I'm disappointed as it's really too big too easily carry around. I've discovered it's not all that easy to use it for reading purposes
1927,2,2935,3,"I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+."
1692,7,3352,3,You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 2 year old it's ok
4088,20,715,4,I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.
3664,20,1131,5,Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
3674,20,1272,1,"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store."
2380,8,3811,4,"I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
2810,8,156,4,"It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet"
3984,20,3481,4,"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
3435,20,3667,5,This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel
2622,8,2875,4,Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life.
2840,2,1129,5,I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
4204,20,3614,5,"No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem"
4896,13,3171,5,"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
1616,8,2038,5,My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.
2471,15,3693,5,"My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
3581,20,2774,5,Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games
2958,15,1076,5,"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
1773,2,1804,5,My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
3459,20,3732,5,Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
1761,8,327,4,It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
2795,7,894,4,my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.

2588,15,2754,4,The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
4157,20,3408,5,"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task."
4709,1,970,4,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
4027,20,568,5,"needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
2752,8,1718,5,"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
4106,20,3335,5,"Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price."
2026,2,253,4,The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it
4152,20,1929,5,I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.
3508,20,3670,5,I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.

2215,8,1247,5,"I purchased this table to use to check my email and get on Facebook, but I use it for so much more. It is a great tablet for a good price."
2698,2,1387,4,It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
2789,2,2532,5,Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
3316,4,138,4,Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps. Go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore. Made my Fire into regular android tablet. Much happier now.
3618,20,1604,5,My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
1889,2,1999,5,The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
2845,7,2773,5,I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.
2071,15,2269,4,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
4043,20,1518,4,Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
4866,13,3706,5,Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
2437,8,145,1,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
4851,13,1972,5,Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
4863,17,1158,5,My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!

2007,2,3105,5,My nephew always uses my sister's iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There's value in the cartoon membership also
3319,4,1178,5,"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product."
3850,20,892,4,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
4984,19,23,4,This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
4815,17,278,5,This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
4974,19,327,4,It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
4847,17,1900,5,Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
4725,1,3757,5,I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.
4958,19,1308,4,This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
2188,2,286,5,"I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters."
1688,8,2076,4,"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
3474,20,401,5,"This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture."
2655,2,3588,4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2814,7,1517,5,"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
4033,20,3760,4,"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."

3565,20,694,5,This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one
4721,1,1647,3,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
2964,8,504,5,Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
2182,8,1729,4,I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
4837,17,2662,5,Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.
4975,19,603,3,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
4190,20,2109,5,"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."

3829,20,2695,5,The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
3770,20,2317,4,Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
3954,20,2910,4,"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
2477,8,718,5,"We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it."
2406,2,1762,5,Great product and great service from bestbuy online
1819,8,2344,5,"I bought this a few weeks ago and use it every day. i've had no problems and it works perfectly! My only complaint is the camera. The pictures are not as clear as I would prefer. All in all though, for the price, I would buy it again!"
3608,20,3338,4,Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!

2087,2,693,3,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
1714,8,2008,5,amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
1762,15,2759,5,"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
4154,20,3548,5,Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
4935,19,2924,4,I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
1721,2,2296,5,"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
2014,2,2583,5,I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.
2386,7,2282,4,I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
3724,20,3491,5,Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
4969,19,3728,4,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
3996,20,837,5,Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product
2343,8,1310,3,"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."
2735,8,1945,5,"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets."
2270,2,2271,4,This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
4094,20,1989,5,"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
1707,8,3708,5,She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much

3891,20,252,5,"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
2906,7,2681,4,"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
4055,20,1632,5,Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
3920,20,454,5,Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
3871,20,2955,4,For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
4908,19,1477,5,For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place.
2460,8,1303,5,So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father's Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!!
2912,2,998,5,Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
2857,7,2414,5,Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
4761,1,2991,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
2955,7,3393,4,My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
1978,8,3551,5,This is a great tablet. Great for the price. Very fast and easy to use.
2661,7,1525,5,"My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."

2367,7,3003,5,"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made ."
3832,20,3697,5,"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
4038,20,206,5,"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
4994,19,1513,5,"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
1953,2,578,5,easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS

2110,2,290,4,Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
3470,20,1300,5,We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.
2620,8,2329,4,I'm super happy and very glad I made this purchase!
3955,20,672,5,This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
2591,8,3756,3,"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK."
2482,2,3184,5,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids
2593,7,3348,4,It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.
3754,20,1979,5,"The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable."
2459,2,2024,4,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
2961,8,2759,4,We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
1574,7,1493,1,"Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas."

4742,1,3647,4,"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
1741,8,2111,5,i bought an amazon fire 7 tablet for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it. it is easy to operate and charge.
1980,2,1986,4,"This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
3900,20,1491,5,I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.
2771,2,3161,5,Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!
2111,2,2206,5,Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.
1813,2,2036,5,"My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight."
2913,8,2724,5,Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
2976,2,1393,5,We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.
1713,5,21,4,"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
2985,2,2429,4,"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
2239,2,1718,5,Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !
4825,17,330,5,Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!

1696,2,2386,5,My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn't cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free
2253,2,287,4,I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
2908,8,1737,5,"Replaced a kindle 6 that crashed so fare everything is great. Larger screen fast response,more storage. Don't have to charge as often. Well pleased."
2720,2,2198,4,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
2274,7,3357,5,I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty.

2201,8,79,5,The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.
3257,4,3034,4,Good products and service and happy with Amazon Fire Tablet
2512,7,1566,5,I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.
1624,8,1825,4,You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
2936,8,513,5,Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
4132,20,1911,4,I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips.
2585,8,3338,5,We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
2852,8,1836,4,We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
3986,20,3008,5,It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks
2351,2,117,3,Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive

4809,13,3611,5,This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
3532,20,3310,4,"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
3894,20,3065,4,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
2405,2,3423,4,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
2635,8,2710,4,It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
3298,4,1773,5,"very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price"

1756,2,169,5,Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
1772,2,3589,5,"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
3626,20,2287,5,"I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it."
2970,2,1428,4,"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
2624,2,1517,5,"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
3570,20,1849,4,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
4993,19,3720,5,I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
3985,20,2116,4,Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
2001,2,130,3,"Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........"

2836,2,2389,5,Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.
3264,4,667,5,The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.
1810,2,3440,1,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
2846,8,3449,5,I bought this for reading/listening books. Love the availability to expand the memory. Now I can load movies and tons of books! :-)

1655,8,3724,5,I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
3457,20,2401,5,"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
2855,2,3511,5,My Grandson loves his tablet we got him. Very safe

1702,15,2132,5,I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.

3730,20,3594,5,Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
4748,1,2163,4,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
3477,20,224,5,Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.
2470,8,3754,5,My son loves his kindle fire tablet. It is perfect

4946,19,3115,5,This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
4981,19,2443,5,"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
2924,7,450,4,"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
1975,2,2733,5,This tab is great for kids and parents alike. I recommend this product to others.
3248,4,3154,5,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase."
2603,8,2993,5,"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
2082,2,406,5,Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.
4012,20,2851,5,Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
3974,20,3557,5,Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for.
1825,8,151,5,Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.

4852,17,1880,4,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
2118,2,1255,4,Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content.
3716,20,3783,5,"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
1822,5,2786,5,"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
2497,15,28,1,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
2250,2,291,4,"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."

2928,2,714,4,"nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate"
2297,15,1369,4,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."

3694,20,452,4,"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
2756,2,796,4,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
2314,7,75,5,This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
1587,2,3437,5,"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"

1814,8,1982,5,The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it
4199,20,2761,5,The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.
4885,17,3647,4,"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
3980,20,122,5,Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
3709,20,2031,5,This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.
3434,20,419,4,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"

3697,20,3321,5,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
3878,20,984,5,"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
2871,2,1338,4,I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!
1957,2,3383,4,It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.
2449,7,3131,5,My kid loves it. It's really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him.
2203,2,1901,5,"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
2526,2,3178,5,This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
2642,2,1721,4,"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app."
2394,2,1011,5,The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.
3568,20,430,4,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all
2305,2,1987,4,This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.
2098,2,3545,5,The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.
1755,7,749,5,This was the perfect gift for grandkids. I bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color. Lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added.

PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
2607,2,2639,5,"My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops."

3311,4,3157,5,"I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot."
2295,8,2039,1,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
2707,7,2419,4,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
4973,19,3640,4,Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
3519,20,823,5,Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.
4875,13,437,5,I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
3272,4,2996,5,"I use my Kindle fire HD 10 in 3 ways 1 for reading Kindle books, 2 for streaming TV shows or movies while riding my exercise bike, 3 to surf the internet."
1824,8,1758,5,Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!

2489,2,3233,4,"good product for youngsters, provides learning and fun together"
4167,20,3770,5,"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
1969,2,1408,5,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful."
2586,7,2890,5,Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
4727,1,3776,5,This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
1785,2,1026,5,"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this"
1694,8,1998,5,Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great.
4047,20,990,5,I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money

3601,20,2490,5,Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!
3236,4,1525,4,Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. Would have given it 5 stars but it hasn't changed enough from the last Kindle that I purchased several years ago.

2382,2,2247,5,Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
2046,2,1691,4,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
3338,4,2002,5,"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer."

3446,20,941,1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.

2238,2,2277,5,My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
4735,1,3300,5,This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
4187,20,2677,3,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
4857,17,2163,4,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
4158,20,154,5,The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos
2124,8,1655,5,This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better.
3243,4,2912,5,"I love the 2 cameras, and the video capabilities. I have set up the picture albums and can even share on Facebook and messenger. I like the side charger. Much better than front.I love the size too."

4962,19,439,5,Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great
3633,20,21,4,"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
2160,2,1325,4,Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
3906,20,2927,5,I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
4934,19,240,5,Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.
4997,19,2533,4,Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
4910,19,1195,5,Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
4198,20,46,5,Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.

3566,20,3621,4,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
2896,2,2005,5,My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
4884,13,1457,5,Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone

2902,7,3344,2,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
3957,20,3815,5,This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven't used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice.
1915,2,1959,5,"Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it"
3622,20,2670,5,I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
4182,20,3591,4,amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
2760,2,3648,4,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
3571,20,1234,5,Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
1878,7,3639,5,My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn't want to put it down.
1913,2,2380,1,It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
3836,20,1252,4,I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
2455,2,1718,5,My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
3818,20,1420,5,Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
2352,15,50,4,"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
1858,8,2050,4,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
4751,1,2921,5,"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
2224,8,2725,1,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
1662,8,1590,5,My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.
3666,20,3099,4,This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
4099,20,1054,5,I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ‚Äãis a very functional and easy to use.
3786,20,3614,3,"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
1719,2,2657,5,"reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use"
3223,4,1564,5,"Excellent value priced 10"" tablet. To bad Amazon killed it. I purchased it as a gift for my wife and she loves the size and quality of the display."
3667,20,629,5,"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
3520,20,2361,3,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
3460,20,2294,4,Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it.
2281,7,1820,3,"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price."
2494,15,152,5,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
2322,2,953,4,"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps."
2686,8,2321,5,This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!
3494,20,3602,5,So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
3812,20,3631,4,"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
3596,20,1946,5,I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
3758,20,2131,5,"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
3903,20,1718,5,Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
2033,2,3735,5,My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!
3753,20,1118,5,Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
2619,2,895,5,"The Amazon Kids Fire keeps my grandson captivated with lots of activities. He loves that it's just right for his little hands. He makes sure that everyone in the family knows the Kindle belongs to him by saying, ""It's mine!"""
4982,19,2088,5,This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
5000,24,401,4,The TV is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs. You have to register it using a code. I tried doing so with my phone but it didn't work. So I called a number on the registering app - Turns out I must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number. This guy told me I needed to pay $99 to register the TV. I said not a chance bozo I'll read the manual and send it back If I have to pay anything else with the TV. I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.
5001,24,402,1,"This TV had no picture. I think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it. Yes, I am sure that's it. I think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before I opened it, but I can't talk about that, per Amazon's rules. Yet, having an adequate cushion is very important. Very disappointed. I love my other Roku TVs from TCL but this one was doomed. TCL should rework this feature."
5002,24,403,4,"I got 3 of these 40"" TV's for the bedrooms at $199 plus tax and I am very pleased with them. Great picture, easy set up and an over all great value. They do have Roku built in so you do have to go thru some steps at Roku.com/link to set up your Roku account. If you already have an account it's even easier. There was no problem connecting to my WIFI and navigating with the remote is pretty simple."
5003,24,404,5," was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room. I got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room. :) 32 is pictured!"
5004,24,405,1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV ITS NOT WORTH IT. It doesn't connect to WiFi and if it does Everytime it is turned on you'll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect. Now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all. When you call the makers of the TV on their support line their 1 and only solution was to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Awful customer service. Awful product. Awful everything. Don't waste your money buy from a better brand. Even at 200$ it's not worth it because for them to call it a smart TV is false. I'm sending it back in getting my money back.
5005,24,406,5,"A nightmare to active TV . As soon as I went to the website to activate tv my phone blew up with people saying I can help you active , but you must create an account first. So I did and could not complete activation until I provided my credit card. Needless to say I did not provide that and 2 hours later finally tv was activated. Obvious i was being scammed because it does not cost anything to activate. Beware of scammers from Roku!"
5006,24,407,3,"The tv is only about 35 inches, not 40"
5007,24,408,3,I liked this at first but now it’s requiring an update and will not update. It’s stuck in a verification loop and now all I can watch is antenna tv. If I wanted I wouldn’t have bought a smart tv.
5008,24,409,3,"The remote on this model feels cheaper than the 52"" model (which we have in the living room). There's a noticeable difference in the quality. If you're looking for a cheap TV I recommend this one but if you pay for the next model up you'll get what you pay for with the higher quality peripheral."
5009,24,410,2,"Very reasonable value, but I can't get the remote to communicate with the tv. There is a clear piece of plastic on the bottom of the tv in the center. Is that supposed to be removed? Customer support is not available on the weekend"
5010,25,411,5,"We love this TV ... We bought the 24 inch TV and linked to to an Alexa device for the Kitchen as it fits under the cabinet. I linked it to our Echo Alexa device and it works great! For kitchen use, 720p is perfectly adequate, and it looks fantastic. I am thinking about getting a keyboard and mouse for it in order to make it easier to find recipes,"
5011,25,412,1,"Beyond disappointing. Purchased this TV solely to have linked to my echo for the hands free voice control. It works for about 30 minutes, and then will proceed to tell me it ""doesnt support that"". I've run the gamut of factory reset, un plug, un link etc. Nothing works and Amazon customer service has no fix for me. I feel like I wasted my money, so to you I say save your money and buy a better quality smart TV for the same price. I will change this review if they ever fix this and decide to help me"
5012,25,413,5,Perfect size for my kitchen wall and with a swing arm I can turn it and watch cooking shows from the kitchen island. Very happy with the TV and set up.
5013,25,414,1,I received 100% damaged TV. Very disappointed!
5014,25,415,4,"So wanted just a cute little tv for my room and this size is perfect, love the remote I can do Alexa or just go straight to Netflix. Has options for cable and hdmi I really only use it for Netflix,Spotify, and hbo. Only downfall is that sometimes on Hulu or hbo it will lose sound or just randomly go back to the home screen which is a tad annoying but besides that sounds good and picture is amazing!! Worth it for me!!"
5015,25,416,4,"I didn't even turn the TV on. Once I unpacked it I realized it had holes for a 100x200 VESA mount. However my wall mount doesn't support that. Given that my wall mount is more expensive than the TV, I'm returning the TV. My mistake, I should have checked first."
5016,25,417,4,So far so good. I bought this from my son to be used a video game tv for his bedroom. So far no complaints from him. Setting it up was a chore. We are cord cutters so there isn’t any cable boxes to hook up but I did have a lot of apps to sign into to. That took some time 😁 It took me sometime to figure out how to get to the actual App Store and not just featured apps and some of the games are very expensive for an app. $15 for final fantasy. Most games average $3 or $5. The picture quality and sound are fine for a bedroom tv. I wouldn’t recommend it for a main room tv unless you plan on using a sound bar. I have his TV set at 30 for volume and it’s not too loud. I only paid $100 for this tv and to me that was a heck of a bargain. He is happy and that makes me happy 😊I paid $4 I believe for a 4 year warranty so this tv should last awhile.
5017,25,418,3,I give it 3 stars because I didn't like how it was exposed at my front door it wasn't covered so everybody knew it was a TV I also didn't like the smell It still smells like battery I had to open my doors and windows because it was so strong but other than that I really like it.
5018,25,419,3,"Love the TV!! However, not happy with the amazon fire! Was not compatible with our WiFi. We were fed up after nothing would load, so I purchased Roku ultra! Wow!! What a difference! Now we’re happy!! I have given a 3 star only bc of having to spend additional money for the Roku. Otherwise, the TV is a 5 star!!"
5019,25,420,3,"Picture is pretty decent, easy to use, sound is good. Only issue I have had so far is that it freezes up sometimes, or the sound stops working periodically and requires the TV to he reset."
5020,26,421,1,"Terrible refurbished tv. The top of the unit was not even put together, Tv never did work, just got strange lines over part of the screen. Returned immediately."
5021,26,422,5,"We use this product for a monitor in our business office, we like our customers to see what's going on in the shop and all the property around it."
5022,26,423,2,All black colors have different shades
5023,26,424,1,Returned because it was broken and we got refunded. No problem on return.
5024,26,425,1,"this is a damaged tv...clear picture, head on only ...look a tiny bit to view left or right...instead of head on...a halo of grey film covers screen. very disappointed and out $200+ do not buy from this seller."
5025,26,426,1,the product never turned on.... For the money it is listed at your better off not buying it and find a LG that works better than this one did.
5026,26,427,5,"Works great, no packaging issues."
5027,26,428,1,Older unit maybe 2010-2014. Also didn't send the legs. So I had to mount it out of obligation.
5028,26,429,1,TV is not turning on for any reason
5029,26,430,1,I would not recommend it due to issues among many things
5030,27,431,3,"I'm sure the product itself is great. It had a wonderful picture and the sound was okay, not excellent. I have a nice sound bar that's more than made up for it. I bought factory refurbished. The TV would just shut off every now and again. Sometimes after it shut off the only way to get it to turn back on was to unplug it from the electricity, hold the power button for 5 seconds, plug it back into the electricity and then turn it back on. I know that trick because of an issue I had with a previous television. I ended up sending it back and not getting another one. I put my Vizio D32f-F1 back up on the mount. The picture quality is not quite the same but it's a bedroom TV. Again, I'm sure the product itself is great but even though I'm a firm believer in certified refurbished to help save the planet I just didn't want to go there again for this particular item."
5031,27,432,5,Great picture. I also use it as a second computer monitor. Netflix and Amazon Prime have a great image.
5032,27,433,5,Is full myself for watching TV
5033,27,434,1,Yea the tv is terrible its showing a white line the top of it
5034,28,435,5,Great picture and easy to install in our RV!
5035,28,436,5,All I can ask for. Well... I would have liked to have a optical cable connection for the sound bar.
5036,28,437,5,Great for rv
5037,29,438,5,Mine just arrived a few minutes ago (6 days before even tthe earliest projected delivery date)!! This TV 📺 l(physically) ooks awesome! I plan to leave an actual review here very soon and update it as time passes for everyone to find out how it performs and holds up with time!
5038,29,439,5,"Seems very good for the price. Blacks are very black, which is good."
5039,29,440,5,"For the price, the picture is awesome. There is nothing fancy about this TV. It is not a smart TV, but it works and looks fantastic in our waiting room. Patients love it. They sit quite a distance from the TV but the quality of sound is good."
5040,29,441,5,So far so good. Looks great! Picture is great!
5041,29,442,4,i had tv for 10 months and lost pic and sound mfd warrenty is still in effect plus extended walmart warrenty so far mfd has had 3 mails back and forth and no tv replacement yet i do believe they will stand behind the product it seems like a good unit time will tell update coming on results
5042,29,443,4,"My only complaint is the sound quality. Play with the settings and it sounds better but still lacking. The picture is good, but there is some white around the edges of the screen on a blank screen. Once the move starts they are not noticeable anymore. Overall $500 is a good deal so far!"
5043,30,1,5,I have been with echo from the beginning and I was disappointed when I opened up my new spot. Of which i had purchased 4 of them and I had specifically wanted them for sound quality as well as the screen and the speakers are on the lower side not the bottom. BUT... when you put this very well built and weighted magnetic connector to the bottom all of a sudden the sound bounces off of this perfectly round circle and spreads out through the Room to sound in for Beautiful so it's kind of like buying a Mustang and not taking it out of 1st a gear unless you buy this piece. You are limiting the sound quality of a beautiful beautiful machine. In short order one Today.
5044,30,2,5,"I was really annoyed I had to spend another $20 on this stand, but I really love it. The ability to position my Spot is helpful. The stand has a nice weight to it and has the same non-slip material that is on the bottom of the Spot. I was very pleased that it magnets so the connection feels very secure. Think the sound is better when on the stand as well. In the end it’s worth the extra $20!"
5045,30,3,4,"Made well, makes spot sound better but should be $10.00 max. Amazon is starting to get greedy!"
5046,30,4,3,"It's perfect for my Echo Spot, but the only reason why I gave it a 3-star is because of the price, I believe $20 is too expensive. It should have been included with the Echo Spot for free."
5047,30,5,3,"For some reason I thought I could move it left an right...nope. It only moves up and down. Not much else out there so I guess I'll keep it. Magnetic connection to base. So, don't be too hard moving it around."
5048,30,6,3,"I love it, it just seems crazy that it’s $20 for something that should just be included in the original product if it was work $5-10 more... "
5049,30,7,5,A must have add-on for the Spot. The tilt function makes it much easier to view when lying in bed.
5050,30,8,1,"It works, but it should cost $2, not $20."
5051,30,9,1,Save your money. It doesn’t work. Will not hold your echo
5052,30,10,3,"It is very responsive and I like the screen display the drop in feature is ok, the camera resolution is sub-par and the audio is very laggy, I use this to check on my mom and there is no nit vision on this camera. But I do think it is listening to everything because after I got this I am getting major spam, also I had to buy a stand this stupid design has the camera facing up to the damn ceiling so if you want to check on something counter height you need a stand!"
5053,31,35,5,"The new Bose Home 500 offers the best sound I have heard in small speaker and Alexa is a fine addition. My Bose is next to an Apple Home and I like the Bose sound much better. The Bose also displays album covers and other information. I easily activated Tune-in Radio, Spotify and Amazon music APPS."
5054,31,36,2,Downloaded the manual. Tried following the instructions on Wi-Fi set up but Bose App does not correspond to the manual's instructions. Been working this all day.
5055,31,37,2,"It sounds great but you can’t says Alexa play whatever from Spotify. You have to use the bose app to play from Spotify. Dealbreaker for me, since I want voice control"
5056,31,38,1,"This speaker looks great, and sounds great, when it works. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work as advertised. It connects to Bluetooth just fine. But so do all Bose wireless speakers. The real selling point of this speaker was it’s seamless connection to multiple music services. That capability is a disaster. My Bose Speaker 500 was extremely difficult to connect to WiFi. Just setting up the speaker was extremely frustrating. It required multiple attempts to connect to the Bose Music app, and I mean I tried dozens of times. The app is horrible, the connection to the device is horrible. And I haven’t even started to discuss how awful the music service playback works. It absolutely refuses to play SiriusXM. Nothing I do works. That was a primary reason I purchased this device, and at this point I’ve given up trying to connect to Sirius. It won’t even play music from my Amazon Prime account, that should work easily through Alexa. No such luck for me. Other elements of Alexa work ok. It will tell me what the temperature is outside, so I’ve got that going for me. Of course, that’s not why I spent $400. It’s a complete waste of money. Do not waste your money on this awful product."
5057,31,39,5,"Bose sound keeps getting better. This was a replacement for an original Sound Dock which finally died. I actually paid for this, unlike some other reviews here. I suspect their value judgments are a Little off. Something for nothing makes it too easy to quibble. Set up was easy as could be. Found my google mesh network right away, updated itself and connected to amazon music, an 8 year old iPod, an iPhone 8, an iPad Air, a surface pro 4 and an iPhone 6 with no issues at all. The sound quality’s amazing. I am an audiophile, and was quite impressed. No substitute for way too much gear, but great for outside the listening room. The app worked perfectly. The engineering was as expected from the company Amar Bose built. Kudos"
5058,31,40,3,"There is a lot to like about this speaker. The sound is great and the design is very attractive. Unfortunately, there are enough pieces that work as well as an Echo speaker. Asking it play to music, it often told me it wasn't authorized until a second attempt leading to an interesting argument. I returned this and bought an extra Echo and the Echo Sub instead. This setup improved sound quality in my opinion. Also everything works better with the straight Echo setup."
5059,31,41,3,"This is a BOSE sound quality speaker. I’ve been using it in a large family room and it is quite capable of filling the entire room with sound as promised. The issues I’ve had with this device are related with the interface between de app and the speaker and the speaker and the router. So far in about a month I’ve had to reboot the speaker 4 times because the “Alexa” functions stopped working or the WI-FI suddenly became disabled and wouldn’t reconnect. I hope that with further updates to the software this issues become resolved, but as this date I would choose another speaker if I was counting on using the AIexa functions of this device."
5060,31,42,1,"I received the order and the product would not work via blue tooth. For example, I would play a song on Spotify, YouTube, Amazon Prime Music, it would play through the speaker, however after 30 seconds to a minute, the music started skipping. To remedy this, I took it to my parent's house (different wifi / diff location), and the same thing. The specific item I received skipped 100% of the time I tried to use it."
5061,33,43,1,Received 2 echo dots - 3rd generation. I thought I needed help setting them up. Contacted Alexa support. I was told that the computer I was using was infected and that I would have to purchase a $149.00 firewall before he could activate the 2 dots. He wouldn't discuss putting another tech on the line. I hung up and figured out what I was doing wrong and got both the units to work properly. Either the tech did not know what he was doing or he was trying to con me. I do like the product so far. Maybe my rating should be 4 stars for product and one star for support
5062,33,44,1," When playing music, sometimes the sound seems distorted specially the highs (trebles). If it happens i have to tell alexa to change music. But after several minutes it will be distorted again. I just got it yesterday, I will observe it if it still does that I may have to return it. I’m very disappointed."
5063,33,70,5,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall. My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night. If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome. I'm really loving it. The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead. I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home. I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc. The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more? Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!"
5064,33,71,5,"As always, Amazon echo dots are perfect. One thing, the Alexa app still sucks and is very user unfriendly. Amazon - can you fix your app and make the GUI more user friendly? Quit the confusing setup process on your APP?"
5065,33,72,5,"So we have 4 of the second generation dots and was excited to see the new one. Set up was super fast, sound and looks great! Can’t wait for the Black Friday special where I can add a few more in the house. Want a cool stand?, we used an old bath and body candle stand, works perfect and looks great!"
5066,33,73,5,"So far so good! The voice recognition is better. I don’t have to say Alexa multiple times for it to work. This one hears me everytime, the first time. The sound is much better so far."
5067,33,74,5,I finally found a woman (Alexa) that listens and can be controlled. (Just kidding) Excellent product. This device saves a lot of time by automating my household items and by adding information and music to areas I spend a lot of time in. Eliminates the need from carrying a radio from room to room.
5068,33,75,5,This thing is awesome. It sounds so good. This is my first device in the echo series and I really like that fact that I can use the app to equalize the sound.
5069,34,101,1,"Could not get it to connect to WiFi. Called their customer service # and was on hold for over 45 mins. Not recommended, unless your looking for an exercise in patience."
5070,34,102,1,Amazon was very deceiving because I tried to buy an Amazon Alexa Echo but only typed Amazon Alexa and this 808 speaker was shown first. I ordered thinking it was Amazon Echo but it’s only a speaker using the Amazon app. It’s difficult to set it up and to this day Alexa is still not playing music from my Spotify Premium account and I don’t understand why. Accounts are set up and connected but still Alexa understands the command but doesn’t play the music. This speaker doesn’t work with battery so you can’t charge it. If not connected then it stops working.
5071,34,103,1,Doesn’t connect to all the music sites it says it will. No Pandora...etc. What’s up with that? And doesn’t play long term...shuts off. Wouldn’t buy it again
5072,34,104,1,The speaker works but the volume is very low.
5073,34,105,2,Couldn't get it to connect with the Echo (2nd Generation) sent back and got 2 Echo dots.
5074,34,106,5,It was a gift to my wife. She likes it. Nothing else matters. I’ve asked it about weather a couple times
5075,34,107,5,The best part was the easy set up. It's basically plug and play. Awesome Amazon!!!
5076,34,108,5,"I love my new Alexa, I am still learning how to use it but it has made my life easier. I love that I can turn my lights on and off without getting up or start my day off with a fresh cup of coffee with Alexis help."
5077,35,200,5,Ive had jbl speakers for years. I was looking into getting a updated bluetooth speaker. I read a ton of reviews about ultimate ears and this speaker hasnt disappointed me at all. It's great sound.
5078,35,201,5,"I love portable bluetooth speakers, but I also have five children. So, I tend to go through a lot of portable electronics (among other things). I bought this speaker after watching an in-store demonstration where an employee started playing music before proceeding to launch the speaker across the store like a football several times before finally submerging the speaker in a tank of water. The speaker never missed a beat. My personal experience has been the same. My toddlers are constantly knocking my speaker off of shelves and have given it several well intentioned baths. Aside fron a few small scratches, the speaker is as good as new. The quality of the soeakwr is also great for its size. Music is clear and crisp and the speaker gets loud. The speaker also sounds the same no matter what direction you turn it. My only complaint is the bass is not as deep as other speakers, namely JBLs. However, the durabiliry of this speaker more than compensates for the bass."
5079,35,202,4,"This is a great music player. I would have given it 5 stars, but I did not read all the small print. It does not come with a charger. It only comes with the usb cord. This was disappointing because I will now have to order a charger..... but it is my fault, I did not read and consider whether it came with a charger. If you want one with a charger, don't order this one. Buyer beware.... "
5080,35,203,5,"I love this speaker, i use it almost daily; while taking a shower or cleaning up around the house. This speaker is loud enough to be heard everywhere. The quality is what you would expect of Logitech and the UE series or products. I have the app with the speaker so I can remotely turn it on with Bluetooth from another room if I choose to or just scare someone who wasn't expecting it to turn on by itself. My 4 year old daughter has dropped it quite a few times and it still works flawlessly. The connecting/disconnecting alert isn't annoying or loud. The battery last quite a long time, i only have to charge it maybe once a week. When you plug in the charger it has a nice pulsing LED that tells you it's charging."
5081,35,204,5,"Great sound on this product. Furthermore, this is the best price I could find for this unit which allowed me to splurge for the SquareTrade agreement in addition. Setup is easy through iOS (iPhone 7 Plus), and using their UEBoom app to update the firmware was a plus. I use this as my bathroom speaker, mostly. But it's enough to fill the house if we should need to. This is my favorite Bluetooth speaker so far, and I used to work at a large fruit company as a supervisor in their stores. I've heard a lot of speakers and these are some of the best."
5082,35,205,5,"This is my second one. To my ears (that's important as SQ is totally subjective) these speakers sound more natural, go deeper in a balanced, tighter manner, have surprisingly clear mids and ok, thought clipped, highs. The first one I bought was lucky as I put zero thought into it. This one I researched and compared it to the UE Megaboom, JBL Charge 3, JBL Xtreme, Bose Revolve+ and Bose Soundlink III. Both my partner and I preferred the Boom 2 in every audible criteria we had. Its not an audiophile speaker by any stretch of the imagination. But its not annoying and to those of us with decent sound systems, cheap speakers can be tests in listening endurance."
5083,35,206,5,"Great speaker with enough oomph to fill a medium sized room. The app works great and even allows you to turn the speaker on/off through your phone. I picked up a second one to make use of the party mode which allows you to either sync up both speakers for true stereo seperation. Build quality is rock solid and I have no worries about bringing the Boom 2 anywhere. UE's newest version, the Blast has some updated bells and whistles, but this older iteration still sounds great and offers awesome value now that the price has dropped."
5084,35,207,3,"I was hopping for louder sound to fill the room. I like richer and full sound, more bass. Personally, slightly disappointed. Speaker is OK, not great. However, sound is very subjective. what is great for one is not great for the other. "
5085,35,208,3,"The speaker sounds great, but the battery life is maybe 2 hours and it is brand new. I have the wonderboom and it is much better. Very disappointed with the battery life. otherwise a great speaker"
5086,36,300,5,"This is the perfect solution for traveling international and using your personal devices such as electric grooming items, cell phone/chargers and laptop/tablet. I travel internationally frequently so this ""one size fits all"" is perfect. I can now leave my pouch of several adapters behind."
5087,36,301,5,Easy to use . Tested for power and the lights come up. Has many different plug and the best thing is the surge protection and it comes wirh a spare !
5088,36,302,5,Heavy and great for travling
5089,36,303,5,So far quite satisfied with the product. Has same safety mechanisms that is comforting. Looks very sleek and durable. Definitely would recommend.
5090,36,304,5,"Worked very well for this first use in France,Germany and Switzerland."
5091,37,700,5,"I bought this for one of my children traveling to Europe to work there for a year. It is absolute perfect, it has everything in one place for all the places in Europe. She can travel and not worry about using her laptop or charging her phone, etc. For anybody traveling a lot, this is the adapter to get, the one that does it all. "
5092,37,701,5,"Great little product. Seems to work well so far. Nice to have so many USBs in addition to the main plug. I do see that it's a little loose in the outlet as some have said, but It stays in the wall fine with a semi-heavy adapter attached. Will give it a fill test next week in France, but so far seems great. Carrying case is a bonus."
5093,37,702,5,Love this charger! Its lightweight anf compact. I can easily carry it in my bag. Plus it has 4 ports! I can charge so many devices at the same time and they all charge fast. I haven't noted any delays in charging or slow charging. 2.4 ans 2.1 A port so you can pick n choose. I charge my watch n phone with this! Plus when Im travelling abroad i take it with me so I dont need to buy a whole new charger! Worked fine in Asia and Europe!
5094,37,703,5,"This compact multi-county adapter is just as advertised. it is relatively small in size and comes in a zippered case (handy)--easy to toss into my travel bag (during or between trips). In addition, the locking mechanism is perfect...something you don't realize you need until you try to use an adapter without one!! it works just as described, and i will buy a second one for a friend. (PS....it DOESN'T include a converter for India, so if that is on your itinerary...you will need a separate plug.)"
5095,37,704,5,"I bought this for one of my children traveling to Europe to work there for a year. It is absolute perfect, it has everything in one place for all the places in Europe. She can travel and not worry about using her laptop or charging her phone, etc. For anybody traveling a lot, this is the adapter to get, the one that does it all. "
5096,37,705,5,I like the fact that it comes in a small size and is easy to pack. I am waiting to use it overseas on our next trip. I think it is nice that it is all purpose because it has three different settings and can be used in many countries. I bought it because the last time we went overseas we needed to have an adapter to use any electronic device such as hair dryer or a shaver to make them work. Different countries have different voltages that they use for their electric appliances and our daily appliances will not work without an adapter.
5097,37,706,5,"I just received the Power Plug adapter in Dec 2018... I purchased for an upcoming trip to Italy. While I haven't yet used it outside the USA, I can tell you that it's very easy to use, completely matches the description from the seller in it's ability to work in Europe, Australia, USA, etc. It's construction is solid and I tested it on my home outlet (of course in USA) and it worked great. My trip to Italy is in June 2019, following that trip, I'll provide an update to this review."
5098,37,707,5,"This adapter is as small as it can possibly be, light weight and simple to use. It even comes with a very nice vinyl zipper case to protect your clothes from getting snagged by the various levers. The directions are clear, but it is well-marked and very intuitive, so they were virtually unnecessary. And — the price is right. Just FYI, if you are including Italy in your trip, you will need a separate adapter. Italy does not use the same electric plugs as the rest of the EU. "
5099,37,708,2,"Not totally opearable in Paris. It charged our phones, but electrical plug did not work for one second."
5100,37,709,1,I bought it for Europe and it did not work in France. I needed it to recharge my phone and it would not work.
5101,37,710,1,I bought this adapter in advance for my trip to Europe. I tried it in every hotel I stayed at during my 11 day tour (4 hotels). It didn’t work. It was too late to send back so I’m stuck with it AND I had to buy a new one in Europe. I do not recommend this product. 
5102,38,800,5,"We purchased this unit for a trip to Israel. We used it to charge I-phones, camera batteries, and power a curling iron. Being able to charge multiple devices at one time was perfect and saved time. Previous reviews were helpful."
5103,38,801,1,"Attempted to use this voltage converter in hotel room in Jakarta, Indonesia. Within 10 seconds of turning it on, it made a popping noise, sparked, and emitted a puff of smoke. The power button no longer functioned (stuck ON) and the two plug outlets did not work. The 4 USB ports did still work. Am returning defective item for a refund"
5104,38,802,1,"This product only supports devices that they do not need convertor. Before purchasing this, first read the label of your device. Almost all the devices listed here, originally support both voltage (110 and 220). "
5105,38,803,5,"I bought this in preparation for a vacation to a few European countries, and found it to be terrific -- it's reliable and I felt that it was safely down-stepping the higher voltage for my US products. As the product description states, this is not for stuff like hair dryers or electric irons -- but for my family's electronic devices (including chargin batteries for an older, high-end digital camera) it was superb. It weighs very little and is easy to re-pack and toss into a backpack. We were all VERY happy with this purchase."
5106,38,804,1,"I’m not an EE, but something is clearly wrong with this device. It works but seems like the ground has AC voltage on it. When charging a MacBook Pro, the laptop’s aluminum case has a subtle pulsing “vibration” when you touch it. Did not seem to damage the laptop, but felt unsafe. Also, how did they get the tiny fan in this device to make so much noise?! Can double as a white noise generator, which is nice if you want a white noise generator."
5107,38,805,4,This converts/charges as described. The fan only gets noisy if it's been running a long time but I never thought it was excessive. We mostly used it to charge our phones and tablets. I did use it for my straightener without trouble because the power was within the right range. Be aware that this is not recommended. I only did it a time or two with a straightener that is a spare. Though Switzerland is not listed it does say continental Europe. You need a different adapter in Switzerland. They are easy to get though I'd buy in the US. Switzerland is very expensive. I've been to 3 parts of Italy with no problems.
5108,38,806,5,"My sister-in-law and I went on a trip to Italy and even though she had plug adapters, she did not have a converter so we both used this. The USB ports were very handy to charge our phones and cameras, and I ran it all night for my CPAP machine with no problems. We were in Italy for 15 days, multiple hotels and sites, and it worked like a charm everywhere we went. The converter was not noisy as some have stated. The sound is like a small fan on low speed. We barely noticed it. I like having the bag to keep everything together, even though I only took the Italy attachments with me on this trip. The only thing I could not use with it was a hair dryer, but I got one here on Amazon that is dual-voltage and was only about $20, and can be used at home or traveling, so that was fine."
5109,38,807,4,"This worked well overseas! Charged multiple devices at one time which was nice. It was a bit bulkier than I had hoped causing me to use more space than I wanted. It has a fan that constantly runs when turned on, I knew this beforehand from reading other reviews but could be an issue for some. It isn't too loud for me but definitely noticeable. Overall a good product."
5110,38,808,3,"Not leaving for a while so can't test it but there are no instructions as to which plug goes to which country, kind of forcing you to take them all. Also the size of the unit looks smaller on the ad than reality. They did not a lie as they did put in the measurements, I just never looked at a ruler. But when you look at the unit in all its parts, unit itself, plugs, cord etc it all adds up to pretty good. SO it gets a harsh rating of 3 because they should have sent complete instructions and added a pic that shows it all together. Looks solid though."
5111,38,809,1,This power converter shot off sparks when I plugged in USB cable for my cell phone and broker while I was overseas. Luckily for me another person let me use their power converter to charge my phone. Cheaply made.
5112,38,810,5,"We travel a lot to Europe where AC voltages vary quite a bit... our equipment, hair dryer, phone charger, tablet charger, etc are all 110ac, so regulating the European outlets is a must... we've used it many times and fully trust this converter.. the warranty is like purchasing an extended warranty, but free... 18 months is pretty much unheard of, that says a lot for the quality of a purchase.. I would recommend to anyone and everyone if you need to regulate your AC power, this is the item to get! (and it comes with all the wall adaptors)... SO, now you can travel worry free…"
5113,38,811,5,"This was great when I was traveling for a month overseas. Love all the ports that it had. My mom, sister, and I could all charge our phones and my mom's smart watch at the same time. lucky I could use the same adapter connection in Canada, Japan, and the Philippines so I only took one outlet adapter with me. I was loud when you start it up. You can hear it while it is on, sounds like there is a little fan inside of it. My cousins in Japan tried to plug in their stuff into my adapter but it didn't have enough watt for their stuff. This was a great product, it is heavy but I carried it in my backpack the whole time."
5114,39,900,5,"I just got back from a trip to Ireland and it worked perfectly! I liked how I could use the USB ports and plug in and use a curling iron at the same time. It has a small light that lets you know it is on and it was great as a night light! With so many country options, it is perfect for the world traveler. I highly recommend it."
5115,39,901,5,"I bought this to travel to Europe with family, with 4 iPhones and other USB devices, I bought another cheaper adapter with 2 USB ports. But we all loved this one because it has 4 USB ports and charges quicker."
5116,39,902,5,"I travel quite frequently to different countries, so the multiple adapter function is wonderful. I just bought this adapter before my Iceland trip and it was great! Worked perfectly. Did not giggle too much in the port. Never fell out. Charges my devices quickly, and met my expectations. When you unplug it there will continue to be a blue glow for about a minute. This is fine, as it is just the remaining current that will quit soon. Definitely recommend. I find it worth the money"
5117,39,903,3,"I was so excited to receive this product ahead of a business trip to the UK and Austria. Basically, it’s good for plugging into each outlet while using a USB cable to charge your phone, smart, watch, etc., but I have been unable to use the adapter for plugging my laptop cable in and charging its battery. Pretty bummed since I had to presentations to deliver and a dead battery. Had to borrow a co-workers plug to get through!"
5118,39,904,1,My first trip out of the U.S. and. My new ( Christmas present ) Unidapt adapter refuses to charge my camera battery or anything else. I ended up using my friends converter and it did the job perfectly . I tried the U K outlets. Very disappointed. The other reviews tell a different story. I’ll get back to you and see how the company warranty works .
5119,39,905,5,This is best thing I took with me to Great Britain. Worked in every hotel from Scotland to Cardiff and did the job great.
5120,39,906,1,"I really hate to give such a low review since the adapter seemed to be fantastic out of the box. Unfortunately, when I landed in Austria, the spring-loaded fuse door won't stay closed which is a pain to deal with. It could be a simple manufacturing random error, but as for MY experience, I was not happy to get to another country and have to immediately go out and buy an adapter when I thought I had been prepared."
5121,39,907,5,Perfect for my UK pot that needed a additional plug. Ez to figure out. Has a light that come on to show it works. As u see in pix they have this black button that opposite of the switches that pushes in when u want to switch push in or push back that specific outlet. Just tried it perfect that i got a second one. Enjoy
5122,39,908,4,"Get it for when you travel! This was great for me that I went to several different countries in one trip and it worked for all of the countries. My flaws for this is that all of the USB ports don’t work. This is a pretty large product so beware, but it’s a good and solid product."
5123,39,909,1,I went to Scotland and on the first usage this completely stopped working. It was also hard to move the different adapters in and out
5124,39,910,5,"Although I won't actually be using it until next week, the adapter appears to be sturdy and very convenient to use. I ordered one of the brighter colors (blue) so it will be easy to locate in my luggage (rather than black like most electronics)."
5125,40,1000,5,"This item is perfectly compact because you don’t need several separate international plugs (as my other units were). This takes the guess work out. I Traveled to South Africa recently and it was great! I simply inserted my usb cords into this product, slid out appropriate plug for that country, and inserted it into hotel outlet. There’s a UK, EU, etc. It worked without any issues. Throw away all those separate pieces of other adapters and just use this ONE!"
5126,40,1001,5,"This is a charger adapter plug for those who travel out of the country. However, as a added feature, it does include American outlets for charging your devices as well. One thing I really like is the ability ti charge more than one device on this plug as well. I dropped it kinda hard roo and it did not break. So, even if you are clumsy, this plug is a good choice."
5127,40,1002,5,"For what you might pay for a cheaper made power adapter, you can get this much better made and more feature rich travel adapter. The USB ports work very well (I have charged three items at once). I have used this adapater in both AU and EU modes and have had no issues."
5128,40,1003,5,No one can have too many adapters - I can be forgetful and get to a foreign country with no way to juice up my iphone and ipad. What I like about this converter is that it has 4 USB also has the ability to plug in any USB devices. The back has pop up prongs for the different converter types. It has a high quality build and is very solid and durable. Love the travel case also
5129,40,1004,5,I travel internationally (US based) for work and pleasure. This will certainly come in handy for my upcoming trips!
5130,40,1005,5,This is great for both international travel and stay at home. It’s got USB ports built in for charging.
5131,40,1006,4,"Would be 5 stars but had to be very careful with how you plugged this in to the wall. Sometimes it wouldn't even stay in so i would need to find a different outlet. Other than that, i was able to charge 4 phones and a tablet at the same time without issue."
5132,40,1007,4,Good product
5133,40,1008,4,"I bought this for an upcoming trip to Ireland. I like the versatility of being able to use it in other countries as well. It has plugs for all of my travel needs,and it comes with a little case to keep it in. I only gave 4 stars because I haven't used it yet, but would definitely give five after successful use."
