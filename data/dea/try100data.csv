941,A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation,1
942,I really enjoy my Fire stick. It's really easy to use.,2
943,Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k.,1
944,Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms.,2
765,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",7
489,Its good I dont know what I am doing. Can u say youtube,1
1360,My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.,2
379,Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.,1
1371,Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does.,2
793,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.",2
1479,The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted,1
743,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,2
270,I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home,0
507,It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn’t play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services,-1
3026,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface.",0
882,The first thing we noticed was Alexa is response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.,2
3180,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,1
3010,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",1
172,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible,1
1108,"I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn't do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus.",1
252,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out.",-2
1269,my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present,1
521,Only download was very slow and echo show did not make it worth having as a stand alone,-2
1165,Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.,1
1352,Fun item and helpful to do things around the home.,2
1515,Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home.,0
1081,The Amazon - Echo Plus is good buy it .buy it you will love it,2
1389,"Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google's, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints.",5
1036,Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great.,1
3003,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",4
1244,Sound quality is very good & Sleek design is nice.,2
1083,We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning,1
922,"Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc.",1
321,"Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks cannot wait to explore more!",4
604,I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product,3
1421,We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she's been great!,2
991,I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as Alexa turn off lights in bedroom. Overall she's amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events,1
983,"bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts.",1
631,"The sound quality is good, Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement",1
531,A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.,1
1268,Definitely worth the money. The sound is awesome!!,2
658,"Yes, it’s a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I’m hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it does not seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.",-2
841,I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.,1
623,I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.,2
1218,great sound. Love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it.,2
323,"Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa.",2
866,"We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun",0
288,This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated!,4
1216,"This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more.",1
2314,This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.,3
5032,Is full myself for watching TV,0
4735,This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.,1
3097,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,0
1469,I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products.,2
4511,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!,2
5066,"So far so good! The voice recognition is better. I dont have to say Alexa multiple times for it to work. This one hears me everytime, the first time. The sound is much better so far.",3
1176,This is a very neat item. Love all the things this can do!,2
2297,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive.",0
2494,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.",1
1868,I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.,3
2482,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids,3
2964,Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.,2
1545,Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable,3
1544,just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.,1
2002,My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.,2
2789,Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.,1
4709,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants.",0
3791,I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.,1
1162,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but Ive read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.,0
5028,TV is not turning on for any reason,0
1312,"As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes.",0
4331,Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!,1
3697,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.,0
3434,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g",2
4761,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",-2
2857,Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!,3
2046,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.",2
733,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.",4
4360,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.,1
2249,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.,-2
5125,"This item is perfectly compact because you don’t need several separate international plugs (as my other units were). This takes the guess work out. I Traveled to South Africa recently and it was great! I simply inserted my usb cords into this product, slid out appropriate plug for that country, and inserted it into hotel outlet. There’s a UK, EU, etc. It worked without any issues. Throw away all those separate pieces of other adapters and just use this ONE!",4
1953,easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS,2
3162,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",3
2970,"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift.",3
3186,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",2
3850,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.,1
4670,"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better.",2
4582,So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy,3
1538,Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.,0
929,"Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item.",1
3571,Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.,1
4672,I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.,1
2585,We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use,2
1127,We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone. We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns on/off.,0
2700,"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books.",2
3264,The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.,0
5041,i had tv for 10 months and lost pic and sound mfd warrenty is still in effect plus extended walmart warrenty so far mfd has had 3 mails back and forth and no tv replacement yet i do believe they will stand behind the product it seems like a good unit time will tell update coming on results,1
