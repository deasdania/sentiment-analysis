2314,7,75,5,3,This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
5032,27,433,5,0,Is full myself for watching TV
4735,1,3300,5,1,This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
3097,11,3479,3,0,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
1469,20,291,5,2,I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products.
4511,1,3635,5,2,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
5066,33,73,5,3,"So far so good! The voice recognition is better. I dont have to say Alexa multiple times for it to work. This one hears me everytime, the first time. The sound is much better so far."
1176,20,3254,5,2,This is a very neat item. Love all the things this can do!
2297,15,1369,4,1,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
2494,15,152,5,1,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
1868,8,1455,5,3,I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
2482,2,3184,5,3,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids
2964,8,504,5,2,Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
1545,3,583,5,4,Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
1544,3,2677,5,1,just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
2002,8,2932,5,2,My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
2789,2,2532,5,2,Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
4709,1,970,4,0,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
3791,20,1025,5,1,I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
1162,20,1732,4,1,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but Ive read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.
5028,26,429,1,0,TV is not turning on for any reason
1312,20,877,5,1,"As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes."
4331,1,2739,5,1,Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
3697,20,3321,5,0,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
3434,20,419,4,3,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
4761,1,2991,1,-2,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
2857,7,2414,5,3,Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
2046,2,1691,4,2,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
733,23,3687,4,4,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product."
4360,1,2437,4,1,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
2249,9,1251,4,-2,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
5125,40,1000,5,4,"This item is perfectly compact because you don’t need several separate international plugs (as my other units were). This takes the guess work out. I Traveled to South Africa recently and it was great! I simply inserted my usb cords into this product, slid out appropriate plug for that country, and inserted it into hotel outlet. There’s a UK, EU, etc. It worked without any issues. Throw away all those separate pieces of other adapters and just use this ONE!"
1953,2,578,5,2,easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS
3162,11,226,4,3,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
2970,2,1428,4,3,"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
3186,11,187,5,2,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
3850,20,892,4,1,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
4670,1,3751,5,2,"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
4582,1,2773,5,3,So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
1538,3,2898,5,0,Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
929,23,1735,5,1,"Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item."
3571,20,1234,5,1,Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
4672,1,2592,5,1,I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.
2585,8,3338,5,2,We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
1127,20,1921,4,0,We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone. We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns on/off.
2700,8,1918,4,2,"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
3264,4,667,5,0,The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.
5041,29,442,4,1,i had tv for 10 months and lost pic and sound mfd warrenty is still in effect plus extended walmart warrenty so far mfd has had 3 mails back and forth and no tv replacement yet i do believe they will stand behind the product it seems like a good unit time will tell update coming on results
2470,8,3754,5,2,My son loves his kindle fire tablet. It is perfect
2969,7,2730,5,3,4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
238,23,3138,3,0,Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated
5003,24,404,5,8,"was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room. I got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room. :) 32 is pictured!"
1551,3,3363,5,2,got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire
3009,11,2469,5,4,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!
431,23,1241,5,2,My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself! So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices. I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell.
2613,2,1049,5,2,My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!
3664,20,1131,5,2,Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
634,23,3785,4,1,Nice except unlike a Google Home you cant just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial
4809,13,3611,5,5,This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
377,23,2463,5,2,"Love the ability to video chat with grand kids, Enjoying the music everyday."
2185,5,591,5,1,"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
2087,2,693,3,-1,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
4132,20,1911,4,1,I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips.
2295,8,2039,1,-5,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
849,23,1760,5,4,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!"
730,23,2638,5,2,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.
4384,1,3612,5,1,I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
1556,3,496,4,2,"pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
5092,37,701,5,5,"Great little product. Seems to work well so far. Nice to have so many USBs in addition to the main plug. I do see that it's a little loose in the outlet as some have said, but It stays in the wall fine with a semi-heavy adapter attached. Will give it a fill test next week in France, but so far seems great. Carrying case is a bonus."
2542,2,3814,5,1,This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.
123,23,2489,4,4,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house."
684,23,2645,5,2,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home."
2477,8,718,5,1,"We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it."
3995,20,1156,5,2,Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
1496,20,1943,4,-1,"The Echo Plus is great. Alexa is the best feature. The only problem is, you cant use it wirelessly. It must remain plugged in at all times, which is kind of annoying."
2661,7,1525,5,3,"My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
2097,8,3361,5,1,"Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,"
2840,2,1129,5,2,I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
4055,20,1632,5,2,Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
4019,20,2757,5,1,I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.
1459,20,3601,5,1,having an assistant like Echo makes life so much easier
4622,1,3078,5,2,I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage.
5051,30,9,1,-1,Save your money. It doesn’t work. Will not hold your echo
1806,7,2675,5,-1,Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids
1756,2,169,5,0,Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
4489,1,3300,4,1,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
820,23,955,5,2,"This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking."
3294,4,1763,5,1,Wish it had its own internet connection but other than that great purchase
3067,11,555,5,0,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.
2960,8,3210,4,0,"Product was a Christmas gift, to replace and older Kindle Fire"
4191,20,1626,5,2,Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.
3457,20,2401,5,1,"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
386,23,1108,5,4,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home."
754,23,3771,5,2,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better
2128,2,2755,5,1,Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.
73,19,1779,5,0,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places."
2010,2,91,5,2,"I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick."
408,23,1829,5,3,Great accessory for Alexis system. helpful and fun
1274,20,791,5,4,"Easy to set up, easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great!"
1702,15,2132,5,3,I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
1370,20,1479,5,2,No issues perfect works as advertised........................
5089,36,303,5,5,So far quite satisfied with the product. Has same safety mechanisms that is comforting. Looks very sleek and durable. Definitely would recommend.
381,23,3079,5,2,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.
1130,20,960,5,4,"This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly!"
3231,17,2714,5,2,The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
1483,20,2035,5,2,Got it as a Christmas gift and I love it! I would recommend this product.
4426,1,3638,5,5,"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy."
3665,20,3463,5,1,"Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use."
3293,4,678,5,4,"This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa."
2142,8,1827,5,1,Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.
4576,1,3614,5,1,Got this tablet cheap than getting the screen replaced
3565,20,694,5,2,This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one
941,2,3266,5,1,A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation
942,2,3665,5,2,I really enjoy my Fire stick. It's really easy to use.
943,2,2944,5,1,Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k.
944,2,2232,5,2,Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms.
765,23,3157,5,7,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale."
489,23,3797,4,1,Its good I dont know what I am doing. Can u say youtube
1360,20,2563,5,2,My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.
379,23,977,5,1,Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.
1371,20,3750,5,2,Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does.
793,23,3019,4,2,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too."
1479,20,2414,5,1,The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted
743,23,13,5,1,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.
270,23,3516,5,0,I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home
507,23,243,3,-1,It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn’t play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services
3026,11,1589,3,0,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface."
882,23,452,5,5,The first thing we noticed was Alexa is response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.
3180,11,3748,5,1,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music
3010,11,2230,5,1,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great."
172,23,737,4,2,Not going to lie - we havent even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible
1108,20,824,4,1,"I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn't do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus."
252,23,1860,3,-2,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out."
1269,20,3480,5,1,my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present
521,23,3039,3,-2,Only download was very slow and echo show did not make it worth having as a stand alone
1165,20,3680,5,1,Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.
1352,20,2370,5,2,Fun item and helpful to do things around the home.
1515,20,1297,5,0,Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home.
1081,20,3165,4,2,The Amazon - Echo Plus is good buy it. buy it you will love it
1389,20,2616,4,5,"Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google's, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints."
1036,20,3315,4,1,Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great.
3003,11,513,5,5,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase."
1244,20,3608,5,2,Sound quality is very good & Sleek design is nice.
1083,20,3199,5,1,We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning
922,23,3522,5,1,"Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc."
321,23,1022,5,5,"Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks cannot wait to explore more!"
604,23,1689,5,2,I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product
1421,20,278,5,2,We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she's been great!
991,20,2476,4,2,I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as Alexa turn off lights in bedroom. Overall she's amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events
983,20,356,5,2,"bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts."
631,23,2600,3,2,"The sound quality is good, Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement"
531,23,2218,5,1,A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.
1268,20,771,5,2,Definitely worth the money. The sound is awesome!!
658,23,1797,4,-1,"Yes, it’s a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I’m hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it does not seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though."
841,23,1303,5,1,I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.
623,23,1160,5,2,I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.
1218,20,3249,5,2,great sound. Love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it.
323,23,701,5,2,"Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa."
866,23,3346,3,0,"We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun"
288,23,118,5,4,This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated!
1216,20,579,5,1,"This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more."
1519,20,2723,4,2,"The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though."
615,23,2539,5,4,"The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo."
1177,20,1414,4,3,"Speaker has great sound and it’s awesome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasnt too sure of, but since Iove installed it I want to get more. Its a great smarthome hub."
608,23,2817,5,2,"Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them."
701,23,68,5,3,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!
232,23,2095,5,4,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!"
930,23,785,5,3,I recommended is very good and practice. Play music is very good quality speaker I see video. I love
3035,11,1556,5,3,Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Like it has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.
713,23,3769,5,2,Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about
498,23,75,5,4,I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wanted one.
1279,20,629,5,1,Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house.
610,23,2166,4,3,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking."
899,23,2373,5,3,The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echos. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.
585,23,1153,5,2,Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome
485,23,30,5,3,A great addition to our home. Kids love it and is vary helpful
482,23,2370,5,2,Bought this for my mom. She thinks it's great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items.
1148,20,1378,5,-2,"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good. however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house. but the built in hub of the Echo Plus is not compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs. so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dots"
451,23,2024,5,5,Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things.
3200,11,3696,5,2,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.
1495,20,2087,5,0,"This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus. It can be turned on and off and also dimmed. The echo Plus is amazing - can play music, control TV and answer many questions."
3130,11,3468,5,1,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR"
351,23,3411,5,2,"This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs"
456,23,3104,5,1,I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it.
142,23,3390,5,1,I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product
881,23,90,5,4,The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product thats compatible with my mothers Arlo Security cameras. It works great!
1451,20,2552,5,1,"The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha"
1112,20,3737,4,3,This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product
908,23,3519,5,1,Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family
3146,11,2197,4,4,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
346,23,2155,5,2,Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.
903,23,3132,4,0,"This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter! If you have Alexa an you like it, a must have upgrade."
392,23,3365,4,0,Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy
1286,20,2349,5,3,"I am so glad that I bought this Echo, it has made it easier to automate my music, and my lights throughout my house. We are still learning to use it, but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items I can control with my Alexa."
3104,11,207,5,1,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.
681,23,1888,5,0,As advertised......................................
751,23,108,5,0,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!
1262,20,424,5,2,"received as a Christmas gift. really works well, we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone, so you don't need to remember to plug in a timer when going away. plays amazon music and sound is amazing"
433,23,528,5,1,I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done
1328,20,3237,5,2,I love this product would really recommend to any one!
322,23,2201,5,2,"Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report"
1030,20,3,5,1,"Love the sound, I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo"
1529,20,899,5,5,"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs."
3151,11,1651,4,0,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.
2987,11,415,5,2,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.
1526,20,1481,5,2,My first Alexa product and I’m going to say I’ve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome
1472,20,864,5,3,I love my Echo Plus!! The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition!!
1070,20,1836,5,-1,Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present
139,23,294,4,1,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights..."
690,23,670,5,2,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc."
1293,20,2383,3,0,When I tried to hook it up it wouldn't recognize my internet. I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working
248,23,2029,5,3,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!"
1531,20,931,4,2,Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings
818,23,2790,5,2,"I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless."
458,23,1941,5,3,I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.
960,20,1653,3,-2,"I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked."
811,23,981,5,2,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.
290,23,3793,4,0,I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next.
439,23,534,5,2,"Have not set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better!"
460,23,2071,5,3,"This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy"
227,23,3044,5,3,Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information
1517,20,605,5,1,"Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit."
1151,20,1607,4,2,Great product. Didnt realize its compatible with different items
3158,11,1391,5,1,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy
