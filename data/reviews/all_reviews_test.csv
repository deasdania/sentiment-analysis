941,5,pos,A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation,2,3266
942,5,pos,I really enjoy my Fire stick. It's really easy to use.,2,3665
943,5,pos,Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k.,2,2944
944,5,pos,Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms.,2,2232
765,5,pos,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",23,3157
489,4,pos,It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube,23,3797
1360,5,pos,My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.,20,2563
379,5,pos,Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.,23,977
1371,5,pos,Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does.,20,3750
634,4,pos,Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial,23,3785
793,4,pos,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.",23,3019
1479,5,pos,The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted,20,2414
743,5,pos,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,23,13
270,5,neu,I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home,23,3516
507,3,neg,It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn’t play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services,23,243
3026,3,neu,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. ",11,1589
882,5,pos,The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.,23,452
3180,5,pos,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,11,3748
3010,5,pos,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",11,2230
172,4,pos,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible,23,737
1108,4,pos,"I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn't do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus.",20,824
252,3,pos,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out.",23,1860
1269,5,pos,my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present,20,3480
754,5,pos,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better,23,3771
123,4,pos,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.",23,2489
1274,5,pos,"Easy to set up, easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great!",20,791
521,3,neu,Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone,23,3039
1165,5,pos,Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.,20,3680
1352,5,pos,Fun item and helpful to do things around the home.,20,2370
929,5,pos,"Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item.",23,1735
1515,5,neu,Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home.,20,1297
1081,4,pos,The Amazon - Echo Plus is good buy it buy it you will love it,20,3165
1389,4,pos,"Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google's, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints.",20,2616
1036,4,pos,Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great.,20,3315
3003,5,pos,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",11,513
1244,5,pos,Sound quality is very good & Sleek design is nice.,20,3608
849,5,pos,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!",23,1760
1083,5,pos,We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning,20,3199
922,5,pos,"Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc.",23,3522

1421,5,pos,We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she‚Äôs been great!,20,278
991,4,pos,I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as ‚ÄúAlexa turn off lights in bedroom‚Äù . Overall she‚Äôs amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events,20,2476
983,5,pos,"bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts.",20,356
631,3,pos,"The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement",23,2600
531,5,pos,A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.,23,2218
1268,5,pos,Definitely worth the money. The sound is awesome!!,20,771
658,4,pos,"Yes, it’s a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I’m hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.",23,1797
841,5,pos,I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.,23,1303
623,5,pos,I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.,23,1160

323,5,pos,"Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa.",23,701
866,3,pos,"We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun",23,3346
288,5,pos,This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated!,23,118
1216,5,pos,"This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more.",20,579
1519,4,pos,"The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though.",20,2723
615,5,pos,"The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo.",23,2539
1177,4,pos,"Speaker has great sound and it’s awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasnt too sure of, but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more. It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub.",20,1414
608,5,pos,"Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them.",23,2817
701,5,pos,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!,23,68
232,5,pos,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!",23,2095
930,5,pos,I recommended is very good and practice. Play music is very good quality speaker I see video. I love,23,785

498,5,pos,I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one.,23,75
1279,5,pos,Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house.,20,629
610,4,pos,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking.",23,2166
899,5,pos,The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echos. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.,23,2373
585,5,pos,Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome,23,1153

1148,5,pos,"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs.",20,1378
451,5,pos,Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things.,23,2024
3200,5,pos,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,11,3696
730,5,pos,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.,23,2638
1495,5,pos,"This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus. It can be turned on and off and also dimmed. The echo Plus is amazing - can play music, control TV and answer many questions.",20,2087
3130,5,pos,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",11,3468
684,5,pos,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.",23,2645
351,5,pos,"This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs",23,3411
456,5,pos,I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it.,23,3104

881,5,pos,The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!,23,90
1451,5,pos,"The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha",20,2552
1112,4,pos,This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product,20,3737
908,5,pos,Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family,23,3519
3146,4,pos,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,11,2197
346,5,pos,Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.,23,2155
903,4,pos,"This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter! If you have Alexa an you like it, a must have upgrade.",23,3132

3104,5,pos,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.,11,207
681,5,neu,As advertised......................................,23,1888
751,5,neu,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!,23,108
1262,5,pos,"received as a Christmas gift. really works well, we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone, so you don't need to remember to plug in a timer when going away. plays amazon music and sound is amazing",20,424
433,5,pos,I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done,23,528
1328,5,pos,I love this product would really recommend to any one!,20,3237
322,5,pos,"Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report",23,2201
1030,5,pos,"Love the sound, I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo",20,3
1529,5,pos,"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.",20,899
733,4,pos,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.",23,3687
3151,4,pos,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,11,1651
2987,5,pos,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.,11,415
1526,5,pos,My first Alexa product and I’m going to say I’ve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome,20,1481
1472,5,pos,I love my Echo Plus!! The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition!!,20,864
1070,5,neg,Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present,20,1836
139,4,pos,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights...",23,294
690,5,pos,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc.",23,670
1293,3,pos,When I tried to hook it up it wouldn't recognize my internet. I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working,20,2383
1312,5,pos,"As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes.",20,877
248,5,pos,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!",23,2029
1531,4,pos,Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings,20,931
818,5,pos,"I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless.",23,2790
458,5,pos,I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.,23,1941
960,3,neg,"I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked.",20,1653
811,5,pos,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.,23,981
290,4,pos,I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next.,23,3793
439,5,pos,"Have not set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better!",23,534
460,5,pos,"This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy",23,2071
227,5,pos,Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information,23,3044
1517,5,pos,"Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit.",20,605
1151,4,neu,Great product. Didnt realize its compatible with different items,20,1607
3158,5,pos,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy,11,1391
1388,4,pos,Nice addition to the home but not essential,20,1710
3037,4,neu,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,11,175
294,5,pos,"I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself.",23,2991
236,5,pos,"If youre like me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door",23,3730

890,4,pos,Great product will recommend it to friends and family.,23,2550
688,4,pos,Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product,23,3246
928,5,pos,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),23,2834
1368,4,neu,Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times,20,1525
766,5,pos,Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!,23,2833
1530,5,pos,Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice,20,3466
892,5,pos,The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away,23,1903
228,5,pos,I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!!,23,525
830,4,pos,"a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen!",23,1374

416,4,pos,"I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this. We also love being able to listen to music, world news, search for items or products and easily order items from this device. We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home. It does so much more. I think this is a great device for the home.",23,397
591,5,pos,I’ve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made.,23,1068
3198,5,pos,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,11,620
736,4,pos,I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information,23,40
557,5,pos,This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display.,23,524
784,5,pos,Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.,23,1741
670,4,pos,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.",23,1377
935,4,pos,"I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven't tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good.",23,226
431,5,pos,My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself! So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices. I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell.,23,1241

764,4,pos,I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.,23,542
3097,3,pos,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,11,3479
466,3,pos,"The device works well mechanically, however, the software needs a lot of work. Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized.",23,903
3073,5,pos,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",11,1063

3186,5,pos,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",11,187

381,5,pos,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.,23,3079
1078,5,pos,Alexa turns on the lights and when I say Alexa good night she turns them off. Love her!,20,1446

203,5,pos,"This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. Its not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired.",23,3814
3117,5,pos,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,11,2531

237,5,pos,he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras.,23,672
697,4,pos,"So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.",23,1081
3175,5,pos,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,11,3217

3210,4,pos,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",11,1524
1205,5,pos,I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home,20,2123
600,5,pos,Great product that a whole family would enjoy. Its a perfect addition to the household.,23,3727
1280,5,pos,"Decent sounding music device...easy to connect and use the app. Getting custom routines set up with smart home (vivint, hue, etc) takes some trial and error figuring out commands. Would buy again.",20,3206

1230,5,pos,"This was a gift that I gave to my daughter at our family Christmas party. She loves it, especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights & her nest thermostat. This has also gone over well with the Grand Children.",20,2129
1121,5,pos,"We finally decided to try the Echo system, after months and months of debate. We purchased the Echo Plus & an Echo Dot. The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs. The Plus's speakers are incredible for its size. We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus.",20,2467
1160,5,pos,"Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me. This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely. Love my Alexa, and love the hue bulb. Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!!",20,2972
876,4,pos,"I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.",23,3664
2995,5,pos,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",11,2198
1052,5,pos,"great for the elderly, makes life a lot easier for everyone",20,3728
212,4,pos,"We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well.",23,346
3004,4,pos,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,11,2283
1164,5,pos,Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights.,20,1334

3066,5,pos,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,11,2412
572,5,pos,I love all my Alexa's I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show. Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family.,23,2946
750,5,pos,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",23,3015
3045,5,pos,Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!,11,3309
547,4,pos,Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound.,23,1348
1162,4,pos,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but Ive read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.,20,1732
3027,5,pos,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",11,2809
178,5,pos,I have the echo and a dot. This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house. Use it every day. I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music.,23,2903

1201,4,pos,Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo.,20,1726
1317,5,pos,Love operation of this system.Bought the mini afterwards for another room.,20,648

324,4,pos,"I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It's very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts.",23,562
1303,5,neg,"Ive been hesitant to purchase this item, didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need. Alexa has changed my mind. I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances, checking weather and adjusting my heat. Alexa can even arm the alarm system.",20,3289
3143,5,pos,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,11,3290
386,5,pos,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home.",23,1108
3057,5,neu,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate,11,280
3012,4,pos,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,11,3134
627,5,pos,I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.,23,1284

199,5,pos,For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside smart alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!,23,1444
1085,5,pos,Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door. Arming and disarming my security system. If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus,20,3345
3046,5,pos,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",11,2806

70,1,pos,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,19,2570

It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",18,3814

Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",9,716

The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.",21,2149
4641,4,pos,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools.",1,2517

4305,5,pos,So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.,1,244
4511,5,pos,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!,1,3635
3413,5,pos,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hard off the unit.,21,1056

3226,5,pos,"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)",17,2893

4345,5,pos,"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc",1,1738
4770,5,pos,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",18,621
2916,5,pos,Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM,9,980

3422,5,pos,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.",21,3628

2014,5,pos,I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours.

Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model.

I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop.

3248,5,pos,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase.",4,3154

2756,4,pos,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age.

1969,5,pos,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.",2,1408

If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.",8,2725

5000,4,pos,The TV is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs. You have to register it using a code. I tried doing so with my phone but it didn't work. So I called a number on the registering app - Turns out I must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number. This guy told me I needed to pay $99 to register the TV. I said not a chance bozo I'll read the manual and send it back If I have to pay anything else with the TV. I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.,24,401
5001,1,neg,"This TV had no picture. I think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it. Yes, I am sure that's it. I think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before I opened it, but I can't talk about that, per Amazon's rules. Yet, having an adequate cushion is very important. Very disappointed. I love my other Roku TVs from TCL but this one was doomed. TCL should rework this feature.",24,402
5002,4,pos,"I got 3 of these 40"" TV's for the bedrooms at $199 plus tax and I am very pleased with them. Great picture, easy set up and an over all great value.

There was no problem connecting to my WIFI and navigating with the remote is pretty simple.",24,403
5003,5,pos," was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room. I got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room. :) 32 is pictured!",24,404
5004,1,neg,DO NOT BUY THIS TV ITS NOT WORTH IT. It doesn't connect to WiFi and if it does Everytime it is turned on you'll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect. Now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all. When you call the makers of the TV on their support line their 1 and only solution was to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Awful customer service. Awful product. Awful everything. Don't waste your money buy from a better brand. Even at 200$ it's not worth it because for them to call it a smart TV is false. I'm sending it back in getting my money back.,24,405
5005,5,pos,"A nightmare to active TV . As soon as I went to the website to activate tv my phone blew up with people saying I can help you active , but you must create an account first. So I did and could not complete activation until I provided my credit card. Needless to say I did not provide that and 2 hours later finally tv was activated. Obvious i was being scammed because it does not cost anything to activate. Beware of scammers from Roku!",24,406

5008,3,pos,"The remote on this model feels cheaper than the 52"" model (which we have in the living room). There's a noticeable difference in the quality.

It works for about 30 minutes, and then will proceed to tell me it ""doesnt support that"".

Has options for cable and hdmi I really only use it for Netflix,Spotify, and hbo. Only downfall is that sometimes on Hulu or hbo it will lose sound or just randomly go back to the home screen which is a tad annoying but besides that sounds good and picture is amazing!! Worth it for me!!",25,415
5015,4,neg,"I didn't even turn the TV on. Once I unpacked it I realized it had holes for a 100x200 VESA mount. However my wall mount doesn't support that. Given that my wall mount is more expensive than the TV, I'm returning the TV. My mistake, I should have checked first.",25,416
5016,4,pos,So far so good. I bought this from my son to be used a video game tv for his bedroom. So far no complaints from him. Setting it up was a chore. We are cord cutters so there isn’t any cable boxes to hook up but I did have a lot of apps to sign into to. That took some time 😁 It took me sometime to figure out how to get to the actual App Store and not just featured apps and some of the games are very expensive for an app. $15 for final fantasy. Most games average $3 or $5. The picture quality and sound are fine for a bedroom tv. I wouldn’t recommend it for a main room tv unless you plan on using a sound bar. I have his TV set at 30 for volume and it’s not too loud. I only paid $100 for this tv and to me that was a heck of a bargain. He is happy and that makes me happy 😊I paid $4 I believe for a 4 year warranty so this tv should last awhile.,25,417
5017,3,neu,I give it 3 stars because I didn't like how it was exposed at my front door it wasn't covered so everybody knew it was a TV I also didn't like the smell It still smells like battery I had to open my doors and windows because it was so strong but other than that I really like it.,25,418
5018,3,pos,"Love the TV!! However, not happy with the amazon fire! Was not compatible with our WiFi. We were fed up after nothing would load, so I purchased Roku ultra! Wow!! What a difference!

5030,3,neu,"I'm sure the product itself is great. It had a wonderful picture and the sound was okay, not excellent. I have a nice sound bar that's more than made up for it. I bought factory refurbished. The TV would just shut off every now and again. Sometimes after it shut off the only way to get it to turn back on was to unplug it from the electricity, hold the power button for 5 seconds, plug it back into the electricity and then turn it back on. I know that trick because of an issue I had with a previous television. I ended up sending it back and not getting another one. I put my Vizio D32f-F1 back up on the mount. The picture quality is not quite the same but it's a bedroom TV. Again, I'm sure the product itself is great but even though I'm a firm believer in certified refurbished to help save the planet I just didn't want to go there again for this particular item.",27,431

5042,4,neu,"My only complaint is the sound quality. Play with the settings and it sounds better but still lacking. The picture is good, but there is some white around the edges of the screen on a blank screen. Once the move starts they are not noticeable anymore. Overall $500 is a good deal so far!",29,443
5043,5,pos,I have been with echo from the beginning and I was disappointed when I opened up my new spot. Of which i had purchased 4 of them and I had specifically wanted them for sound quality as well as the screen and the speakers are on the lower side not the bottom. BUT... when you put this very well built and weighted magnetic connector to the bottom all of a sudden the sound bounces off of this perfectly round circle and spreads out through the Room to sound in for Beautiful so it's kind of like buying a Mustang and not taking it out of 1st a gear unless you buy this piece. You are limiting the sound quality of a beautiful beautiful machine. In short order one Today.,30,1
5044,5,pos,"I was really annoyed I had to spend another $20 on this stand, but I really love it. The ability to position my Spot is helpful. The stand has a nice weight to it and has the same non-slip material that is on the bottom of the Spot. I was very pleased that it magnets so the connection feels very secure. Think the sound is better when on the stand as well. In the end it’s worth the extra $20!",30,2
5045,4,neu,"Made well, makes spot sound better but should be $10.00 max. Amazon is starting to get greedy!",30,3
5046,3,pos,"It's perfect for my Echo Spot, but the only reason why I gave it a 3-star is because of the price, I believe $20 is too expensive. It should have been included with the Echo Spot for free.",30,4
5047,3,pos,"For some reason I thought I could move it left an right...nope. It only moves up and down. Not much else out there so I guess I'll keep it. Magnetic connection to base. So, don't be too hard moving it around.",30,5
5048,3,pos,"I love it, it just seems crazy that it’s $20 for something that should just be included in the original product if it was work $5-10 more... ",30,6
5049,5,pos,A must have add-on for the Spot. The tilt function makes it much easier to view when lying in bed.,30,7

5056,1,neg,"This speaker looks great, and sounds great, when it works. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work as advertised. It connects to Bluetooth just fine. But so do all Bose wireless speakers. The real selling point of this speaker was it’s seamless connection to multiple music services. That capability is a disaster. My Bose Speaker 500 was extremely difficult to connect to WiFi. Just setting up the speaker was extremely frustrating. It required multiple attempts to connect to the Bose Music app, and I mean I tried dozens of times. The app is horrible, the connection to the device is horrible. And I haven’t even started to discuss how awful the music service playback works. It absolutely refuses to play SiriusXM. Nothing I do works. That was a primary reason I purchased this device, and at this point I’ve given up trying to connect to Sirius. It won’t even play music from my Amazon Prime account, that should work easily through Alexa. No such luck for me. Other elements of Alexa work ok. It will tell me what the temperature is outside, so I’ve got that going for me. Of course, that’s not why I spent $400. It’s a complete waste of money. Do not waste your money on this awful product.",31,38
5057,5,pos,"Bose sound keeps getting better. This was a replacement for an original Sound Dock which finally died. I actually paid for this, unlike some other reviews here. I suspect their value judgments are a Little off. Something for nothing makes it too easy to quibble. Set up was easy as could be. Found my google mesh network right away, updated itself and connected to amazon music, an 8 year old iPod, an iPhone 8, an iPad Air, a surface pro 4 and an iPhone 6 with no issues at all. The sound quality’s amazing. I am an audiophile, and was quite impressed. No substitute for way too much gear, but great for outside the listening room. The app worked perfectly. The engineering was as expected from the company Amar Bose built. Kudos",31,39
5058,3,pos,"There is a lot to like about this speaker. The sound is great and the design is very attractive. Unfortunately, there are enough pieces that work as well as an Echo speaker. Asking it play to music, it often told me it wasn't authorized until a second attempt leading to an interesting argument. I returned this and bought an extra Echo and the Echo Sub instead. This setup improved sound quality in my opinion. Also everything works better with the straight Echo setup.",31,40
5059,3,pos,"This is a BOSE sound quality speaker. I’ve been using it in a large family room and it is quite capable of filling the entire room with sound as promised. The issues I’ve had with this device are related with the interface between de app and the speaker and the speaker and the router. So far in about a month I’ve had to reboot the speaker 4 times because the “Alexa” functions stopped working or the WI-FI suddenly became disabled and wouldn’t reconnect. I hope that with further updates to the software this issues become resolved, but as this date I would choose another speaker if I was counting on using the AIexa functions of this device.",31,41
5060,1,neu,"I received the order and the product would not work via blue tooth. For example, I would play a song on Spotify, YouTube, Amazon Prime Music, it would play through the speaker, however after 30 seconds to a minute, the music started skipping. To remedy this, I took it to my parent's house (different wifi / diff location), and the same thing. The specific item I received skipped 100% of the time I tried to use it.",31,42
5061,1,pos,Received 2 echo dots - 3rd generation. I thought I needed help setting them up. Contacted Alexa support. I was told that the computer I was using was infected and that I would have to purchase a $149.00 firewall before he could activate the 2 dots. He wouldn't discuss putting another tech on the line. I hung up and figured out what I was doing wrong and got both the units to work properly. Either the tech did not know what he was doing or he was trying to con me. I do like the product so far. Maybe my rating should be 4 stars for product and one star for support,33,43
5062,1,neg," When playing music, sometimes the sound seems distorted specially the highs (trebles). If it happens i have to tell alexa to change music. But after several minutes it will be distorted again. I just got it yesterday, I will observe it if it still does that I may have to return it. I’m very disappointed.",33,44
5063,5,pos,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall. My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night. If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome. I'm really loving it. The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead. I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home. I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc. The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more? Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!",33,70
5064,5,neg,"As always, Amazon echo dots are perfect. One thing, the Alexa app still sucks and is very user unfriendly. Amazon - can you fix your app and make the GUI more user friendly? Quit the confusing setup process on your APP?",33,71
5065,5,pos,"So we have 4 of the second generation dots and was excited to see the new one. Set up was super fast, sound and looks great! Can’t wait for the Black Friday special where I can add a few more in the house. Want a cool stand?, we used an old bath and body candle stand, works perfect and looks great!",33,72
5066,5,pos,"So far so good! The voice recognition is better. I don’t have to say Alexa multiple times for it to work. This one hears me everytime, the first time. The sound is much better so far.",33,73
5067,5,pos,I finally found a woman (Alexa) that listens and can be controlled. (Just kidding) Excellent product. This device saves a lot of time by automating my household items and by adding information and music to areas I spend a lot of time in. Eliminates the need from carrying a radio from room to room.,33,74

5070,1,neg,Amazon was very deceiving because I tried to buy an Amazon Alexa Echo but only typed Amazon Alexa and this 808 speaker was shown first. I ordered thinking it was Amazon Echo but it’s only a speaker using the Amazon app. It’s difficult to set it up and to this day Alexa is still not playing music from my Spotify Premium account and I don’t understand why. Accounts are set up and connected but still Alexa understands the command but doesn’t play the music. This speaker doesn’t work with battery so you can’t charge it. If not connected then it stops working.,34,102

5076,5,pos,"I love my new Alexa, I am still learning how to use it but it has made my life easier. I love that I can turn my lights on and off without getting up or start my day off with a fresh cup of coffee with Alexis help.",34,108
5077,5,pos,Ive had jbl speakers for years. I was looking into getting a updated bluetooth speaker. I read a ton of reviews about ultimate ears and this speaker hasnt disappointed me at all. It's great sound.,35,200
5078,5,pos,"I love portable bluetooth speakers, but I also have five children. So, I tend to go through a lot of portable electronics (among other things). I bought this speaker after watching an in-store demonstration where an employee started playing music before proceeding to launch the speaker across the store like a football several times before finally submerging the speaker in a tank of water. The speaker never missed a beat. My personal experience has been the same. My toddlers are constantly knocking my speaker off of shelves and have given it several well intentioned baths. Aside fron a few small scratches, the speaker is as good as new. The quality of the soeakwr is also great for its size. Music is clear and crisp and the speaker gets loud. The speaker also sounds the same no matter what direction you turn it. My only complaint is the bass is not as deep as other speakers, namely JBLs. However, the durabiliry of this speaker more than compensates for the bass.",35,201
5079,4,neg,"This is a great music player. I would have given it 5 stars, but I did not read all the small print. It does not come with a charger. It only comes with the usb cord. This was disappointing because I will now have to order a charger..... but it is my fault, I did not read and consider whether it came with a charger. If you want one with a charger, don't order this one. Buyer beware.... ",35,202
5080,5,pos,"I love this speaker, i use it almost daily; while taking a shower or cleaning up around the house. This speaker is loud enough to be heard everywhere. The quality is what you would expect of Logitech and the UE series or products. I have the app with the speaker so I can remotely turn it on with Bluetooth from another room if I choose to or just scare someone who wasn't expecting it to turn on by itself. My 4 year old daughter has dropped it quite a few times and it still works flawlessly. The connecting/disconnecting alert isn't annoying or loud. The battery last quite a long time, i only have to charge it maybe once a week. When you plug in the charger it has a nice pulsing LED that tells you it's charging.",35,203
5081,5,pos,"Great sound on this product. Furthermore, this is the best price I could find for this unit which allowed me to splurge for the SquareTrade agreement in addition. Setup is easy through iOS (iPhone 7 Plus), and using their UEBoom app to update the firmware was a plus. I use this as my bathroom speaker, mostly. But it's enough to fill the house if we should need to. This is my favorite Bluetooth speaker so far, and I used to work at a large fruit company as a supervisor in their stores. I've heard a lot of speakers and these are some of the best.",35,204
5082,5,pos,"This is my second one. To my ears (that's important as SQ is totally subjective) these speakers sound more natural, go deeper in a balanced, tighter manner, have surprisingly clear mids and ok, thought clipped, highs. The first one I bought was lucky as I put zero thought into it. This one I researched and compared it to the UE Megaboom, JBL Charge 3, JBL Xtreme, Bose Revolve+ and Bose Soundlink III. Both my partner and I preferred the Boom 2 in every audible criteria we had. Its not an audiophile speaker by any stretch of the imagination. But its not annoying and to those of us with decent sound systems, cheap speakers can be tests in listening endurance.",35,205
5083,5,pos,"Great speaker with enough oomph to fill a medium sized room. The app works great and even allows you to turn the speaker on/off through your phone. I picked up a second one to make use of the party mode which allows you to either sync up both speakers for true stereo seperation. Build quality is rock solid and I have no worries about bringing the Boom 2 anywhere. UE's newest version, the Blast has some updated bells and whistles, but this older iteration still sounds great and offers awesome value now that the price has dropped.",35,206
5084,3,neg,"I was hopping for louder sound to fill the room. I like richer and full sound, more bass. Personally, slightly disappointed. Speaker is OK, not great. However, sound is very subjective. what is great for one is not great for the other. ",35,207
5085,3,pos,"The speaker sounds great, but the battery life is maybe 2 hours and it is brand new. I have the wonderboom and it is much better. Very disappointed with the battery life. otherwise a great speaker",35,208
5086,5,pos,"This is the perfect solution for traveling international and using your personal devices such as electric grooming items, cell phone/chargers and laptop/tablet. I travel internationally frequently so this ""one size fits all"" is perfect. I can now leave my pouch of several adapters behind.",36,300
5087,5,pos,Easy to use . Tested for power and the lights come up. Has many different plug and the best thing is the surge protection and it comes wirh a spare !,36,301
5088,5,pos,Heavy and great for travling,36,302
5089,5,pos,So far quite satisfied with the product. Has same safety mechanisms that is comforting. Looks very sleek and durable. Definitely would recommend.,36,303
5090,5,pos,"Worked very well for this first use in France,Germany and Switzerland.",36,304
5091,5,pos,"I bought this for one of my children traveling to Europe to work there for a year. It is absolute perfect, it has everything in one place for all the places in Europe. She can travel and not worry about using her laptop or charging her phone, etc. For anybody traveling a lot, this is the adapter to get, the one that does it all. ",37,700
5092,5,pos,"Great little product. Seems to work well so far. Nice to have so many USBs in addition to the main plug. I do see that it's a little loose in the outlet as some have said, but It stays in the wall fine with a semi-heavy adapter attached. Will give it a fill test next week in France, but so far seems great. Carrying case is a bonus.",37,701
5093,5,pos,Love this charger! Its lightweight anf compact. I can easily carry it in my bag. Plus it has 4 ports! I can charge so many devices at the same time and they all charge fast. I haven't noted any delays in charging or slow charging. 2.4 ans 2.1 A port so you can pick n choose. I charge my watch n phone with this! Plus when Im travelling abroad i take it with me so I dont need to buy a whole new charger! Worked fine in Asia and Europe!,37,702
5094,5,pos,"This compact multi-county adapter is just as advertised. it is relatively small in size and comes in a zippered case (handy)--easy to toss into my travel bag (during or between trips). In addition, the locking mechanism is perfect...something you don't realize you need until you try to use an adapter without one!! it works just as described, and i will buy a second one for a friend. (PS....it DOESN'T include a converter for India, so if that is on your itinerary...you will need a separate plug.)",37,703
5095,5,pos,"I bought this for one of my children traveling to Europe to work there for a year. It is absolute perfect, it has everything in one place for all the places in Europe.

5096,5,pos,I like the fact that it comes in a small size and is easy to pack. I am waiting to use it overseas on our next trip. I think it is nice that it is all purpose because it has three different settings and can be used in many countries. I bought it because the last time we went overseas we needed to have an adapter to use any electronic device such as hair dryer or a shaver to make them work. Different countries have different voltages that they use for their electric appliances and our daily appliances will not work without an adapter.,37,705
5097,5,pos,"I just received the Power Plug adapter in Dec 2018... I purchased for an upcoming trip to Italy. While I haven't yet used it outside the USA, I can tell you that it's very easy to use, completely matches the description from the seller in it's ability to work in Europe, Australia, USA, etc. It's construction is solid and I tested it on my home outlet (of course in USA) and it worked great. My trip to Italy is in June 2019, following that trip, I'll provide an update to this review.",37,706
5098,5,pos,"This adapter is as small as it can possibly be, light weight and simple to use. It even comes with a very nice vinyl zipper case to protect your clothes from getting snagged by the various levers. The directions are clear, but it is well-marked and very intuitive, so they were virtually unnecessary. And — the price is right. Just FYI, if you are including Italy in your trip, you will need a separate adapter. Italy does not use the same electric plugs as the rest of the EU. ",37,707
5099,2,neg,"Not totally opearable in Paris. It charged our phones, but electrical plug did not work for one second.",37,708
5100,1,neg,I bought it for Europe and it did not work in France. I needed it to recharge my phone and it would not work.,37,709
5101,1,neg,I bought this adapter in advance for my trip to Europe. I tried it in every hotel I stayed at during my 11 day tour (4 hotels). It didn’t work. It was too late to send back so I’m stuck with it AND I had to buy a new one in Europe. I do not recommend this product. ,37,710
5102,5,pos,"We purchased this unit for a trip to Israel. We used it to charge I-phones, camera batteries, and power a curling iron. Being able to charge multiple devices at one time was perfect and saved time. Previous reviews were helpful.",38,800
5103,1,neg,"Attempted to use this voltage converter in hotel room in Jakarta, Indonesia. Within 10 seconds of turning it on, it made a popping noise, sparked, and emitted a puff of smoke. The power button no longer functioned (stuck ON) and the two plug outlets did not work. The 4 USB ports did still work. Am returning defective item for a refund",38,801
5104,1,pos,"This product only supports devices that they do not need convertor. Before purchasing this, first read the label of your device. Almost all the devices listed here, originally support both voltage (110 and 220). ",38,802
5105,5,pos,"I bought this in preparation for a vacation to a few European countries, and found it to be terrific -- it's reliable and I felt that it was safely down-stepping the higher voltage for my US products. As the product description states, this is not for stuff like hair dryers or electric irons -- but for my family's electronic devices (including chargin batteries for an older, high-end digital camera) it was superb. It weighs very little and is easy to re-pack and toss into a backpack. We were all VERY happy with this purchase.",38,803
5106,1,pos,"I’m not an EE, but something is clearly wrong with this device. It works but seems like the ground has AC voltage on it. When charging a MacBook Pro, the laptop’s aluminum case has a subtle pulsing “vibration” when you touch it. Did not seem to damage the laptop, but felt unsafe. Also, how did they get the tiny fan in this device to make so much noise?! Can double as a white noise generator, which is nice if you want a white noise generator.",38,804
5107,4,pos,This converts/charges as described. The fan only gets noisy if it's been running a long time but I never thought it was excessive. We mostly used it to charge our phones and tablets. I did use it for my straightener without trouble because the power was within the right range. Be aware that this is not recommended. I only did it a time or two with a straightener that is a spare. Though Switzerland is not listed it does say continental Europe. You need a different adapter in Switzerland. They are easy to get though I'd buy in the US. Switzerland is very expensive. I've been to 3 parts of Italy with no problems.,38,805
5108,5,pos,"My sister-in-law and I went on a trip to Italy and even though she had plug adapters, she did not have a converter so we both used this. The USB ports were very handy to charge our phones and cameras, and I ran it all night for my CPAP machine with no problems. We were in Italy for 15 days, multiple hotels and sites, and it worked like a charm everywhere we went. The converter was not noisy as some have stated. The sound is like a small fan on low speed. We barely noticed it. I like having the bag to keep everything together, even though I only took the Italy attachments with me on this trip. The only thing I could not use with it was a hair dryer, but I got one here on Amazon that is dual-voltage and was only about $20, and can be used at home or traveling, so that was fine.",38,806
5109,4,pos,"This worked well overseas! Charged multiple devices at one time which was nice. It was a bit bulkier than I had hoped causing me to use more space than I wanted. It has a fan that constantly runs when turned on, I knew this beforehand from reading other reviews but could be an issue for some. It isn't too loud for me but definitely noticeable. Overall a good product.",38,807
5110,3,pos,"Not leaving for a while so can't test it but there are no instructions as to which plug goes to which country, kind of forcing you to take them all. Also the size of the unit looks smaller on the ad than reality. They did not a lie as they did put in the measurements, I just never looked at a ruler. But when you look at the unit in all its parts, unit itself, plugs, cord etc it all adds up to pretty good. SO it gets a harsh rating of 3 because they should have sent complete instructions and added a pic that shows it all together. Looks solid though.",38,808
5111,1,neu,This power converter shot off sparks when I plugged in USB cable for my cell phone and broker while I was overseas. Luckily for me another person let me use their power converter to charge my phone. Cheaply made.,38,809
5112,5,pos,"We travel a lot to Europe where AC voltages vary quite a bit... our equipment, hair dryer, phone charger, tablet charger, etc are all 110ac, so regulating the European outlets is a must... we've used it many times and fully trust this converter.. the warranty is like purchasing an extended warranty, but free... 18 months is pretty much unheard of, that says a lot for the quality of a purchase.. I would recommend to anyone and everyone if you need to regulate your AC power, this is the item to get! (and it comes with all the wall adaptors)... SO, now you can travel worry free…",38,810
5113,5,pos,"This was great when I was traveling for a month overseas. Love all the ports that it had. My mom, sister, and I could all charge our phones and my mom's smart watch at the same time. lucky I could use the same adapter connection in Canada, Japan, and the Philippines so I only took one outlet adapter with me. I was loud when you start it up. You can hear it while it is on, sounds like there is a little fan inside of it. My cousins in Japan tried to plug in their stuff into my adapter but it didn't have enough watt for their stuff. This was a great product, it is heavy but I carried it in my backpack the whole time.",38,811
5114,5,pos,"I just got back from a trip to Ireland and it worked perfectly! I liked how I could use the USB ports and plug in and use a curling iron at the same time. It has a small light that lets you know it is on and it was great as a night light! With so many country options, it is perfect for the world traveler. I highly recommend it.",39,900
5115,5,pos,"I bought this to travel to Europe with family, with 4 iPhones and other USB devices, I bought another cheaper adapter with 2 USB ports. But we all loved this one because it has 4 USB ports and charges quicker.",39,901
5116,5,pos,"I travel quite frequently to different countries, so the multiple adapter function is wonderful. I just bought this adapter before my Iceland trip and it was great! Worked perfectly. Did not giggle too much in the port. Never fell out. Charges my devices quickly, and met my expectations. When you unplug it there will continue to be a blue glow for about a minute. This is fine, as it is just the remaining current that will quit soon. Definitely recommend. I find it worth the money",39,902
5117,3,pos,"I was so excited to receive this product ahead of a business trip to the UK and Austria. Basically, it’s good for plugging into each outlet while using a USB cable to charge your phone, smart, watch, etc., but I have been unable to use the adapter for plugging my laptop cable in and charging its battery. Pretty bummed since I had to presentations to deliver and a dead battery. Had to borrow a co-workers plug to get through!",39,903
5118,1,neu,My first trip out of the U.S. and. My new ( Christmas present ) Unidapt adapter refuses to charge my camera battery or anything else. I ended up using my friends converter and it did the job perfectly . I tried the U K outlets. Very disappointed. The other reviews tell a different story. I’ll get back to you and see how the company warranty works .,39,904
5119,5,pos,This is best thing I took with me to Great Britain. Worked in every hotel from Scotland to Cardiff and did the job great.,39,905
5120,1,neg,"I really hate to give such a low review since the adapter seemed to be fantastic out of the box. Unfortunately, when I landed in Austria, the spring-loaded fuse door won't stay closed which is a pain to deal with. It could be a simple manufacturing random error, but as for MY experience, I was not happy to get to another country and have to immediately go out and buy an adapter when I thought I had been prepared.",39,906
5121,5,pos,Perfect for my UK pot that needed a additional plug. Ez to figure out. Has a light that come on to show it works. As u see in pix they have this black button that opposite of the switches that pushes in when u want to switch push in or push back that specific outlet. Just tried it perfect that i got a second one. Enjoy,39,907
5122,4,neu,"Get it for when you travel! This was great for me that I went to several different countries in one trip and it worked for all of the countries. My flaws for this is that all of the USB ports don’t work. This is a pretty large product so beware, but it’s a good and solid product.",39,908
5123,1,neg,I went to Scotland and on the first usage this completely stopped working. It was also hard to move the different adapters in and out,39,909
5124,5,pos,"Although I won't actually be using it until next week, the adapter appears to be sturdy and very convenient to use. I ordered one of the brighter colors (blue) so it will be easy to locate in my luggage (rather than black like most electronics).",39,910
5125,5,pos,"This item is perfectly compact because you don’t need several separate international plugs (as my other units were). This takes the guess work out. I Traveled to South Africa recently and it was great! I simply inserted my usb cords into this product, slid out appropriate plug for that country, and inserted it into hotel outlet. There’s a UK, EU, etc. It worked without any issues. Throw away all those separate pieces of other adapters and just use this ONE!",40,1000
5126,5,pos,"This is a charger adapter plug for those who travel out of the country. However, as a added feature, it does include American outlets for charging your devices as well. One thing I really like is the ability ti charge more than one device on this plug as well. I dropped it kinda hard roo and it did not break. So, even if you are clumsy, this plug is a good choice.",40,1001
5127,5,pos,"For what you might pay for a cheaper made power adapter, you can get this much better made and more feature rich travel adapter. The USB ports work very well (I have charged three items at once). I have used this adapater in both AU and EU modes and have had no issues.",40,1002
5128,5,pos,No one can have too many adapters - I can be forgetful and get to a foreign country with no way to juice up my iphone and ipad. What I like about this converter is that it has 4 USB also has the ability to plug in any USB devices. The back has pop up prongs for the different converter types. It has a high quality build and is very solid and durable. Love the travel case also,40,1003
5129,5,pos,I travel internationally (US based) for work and pleasure. This will certainly come in handy for my upcoming trips!,40,1004
5130,5,pos,This is great for both international travel and stay at home. It’s got USB ports built in for charging.,40,1005
5131,4,neu,"Would be 5 stars but had to be very careful with how you plugged this in to the wall. Sometimes it wouldn't even stay in so i would need to find a different outlet. Other than that, i was able to charge 4 phones and a tablet at the same time without issue.",40,1006
5132,4,pos,Good product,40,1007
5133,4,pos,"I bought this for an upcoming trip to Ireland. I like the versatility of being able to use it in other countries as well. It has plugs for all of my travel needs,and it comes with a little case to keep it in. I only gave 4 stars because I haven't used it yet, but would definitely give five after successful use.",40,1008
