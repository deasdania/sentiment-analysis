4416,4,neu,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.,1,2908
4426,5,pos,"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy.",1,3638
70,1,pos,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,19,2570
4701,4,pos,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books.

2249,4,neg,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.,9,1251
4349,1,neg,Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.,1,1071

4609,5,neg,"Nice camera. Learning how to use it, but it is easy",1,2107
4793,5,pos,"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",18,3814

3303,5,pos,"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!",17,59
3356,5,pos,Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.,21,2566

2465,5,pos,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",9,716
2929,5,pos,very good product and service will refer a friend.,9,1110
95,5,pos,This was purchased as a gift and they've absolutely loved it.,19,3281

1739,5,pos,I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.,9,1419

89,5,pos,Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.,19,1369
3414,4,pos,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.",21,2149
4641,4,pos,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools.",1,2517
4313,3,pos,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.,1,2753

4542,4,pos,"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it.",1,2430
4305,5,pos,So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.,1,244
4511,5,pos,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!,1,3635
3413,5,pos,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hard off the unit.,21,1056
4652,4,pos,I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!,1,544
1964,5,pos,The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.,9,3167
4506,5,pos,"Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!",1,3772
1571,5,pos,My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.,9,1078
4705,5,pos,Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature.,12,898
2228,5,pos,"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time.",9,1132
4573,5,pos,"Works great, makes a great gift! .................",1,2204
68,5,pos,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.,19,3306
4576,5,pos,Got this tablet cheap than getting the screen replaced,1,3614
4700,5,pos,"I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool",12,2889
3226,5,pos,"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)",17,2893
4307,5,neu,I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps,1,2919

66,5,pos,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",19,1401
4345,5,pos,"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc",1,1738
4770,5,pos,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",18,621
2916,5,pos,Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM,9,980
86,5,pos,Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where,19,1946
4281,5,pos,"The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It's screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket.",1,3703
4431,5,pos,"For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to!",1,3571
4220,5,pos,This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!,1,344
4535,5,pos,I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet,1,2282
4425,5,pos,I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!,1,2780
4383,5,pos,I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.,1,512
4672,5,pos,I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.,1,2592
4245,5,pos,"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around.",1,2023
73,5,pos,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places.",19,1779
2716,4,pos,"I like this ereader. It is a little small, but you can increase the font.",9,2145
4427,5,pos,Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.,1,3381
2549,5,pos,I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.,9,302
3391,5,pos,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.,21,1579
3411,5,pos,"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.",21,1757
4366,4,pos,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that,1,354
3422,5,pos,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.",21,3628
4679,5,pos,"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all",1,1959

4566,5,pos,Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.,1,350
4318,5,pos,Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre,1,2639

4632,4,pos,My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.,1,3427
4222,2,neg,I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.,1,2482
87,4,pos,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two.",19,2695
2369,5,pos,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional.

4348,5,pos,Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems,1,2111
4767,5,pos,The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case,18,2330
45,5,pos,"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons.",19,2171
4458,5,pos,"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price.",1,2684
2136,4,pos,"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light.",9,3048
3307,4,pos,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",17,3727
