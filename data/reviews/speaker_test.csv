765,5,pos,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",23,3157
489,4,pos,It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube,23,3797
1360,5,pos,My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.,20,2563
379,5,pos,Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.,23,977
1371,5,pos,Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does.,20,3750
634,4,pos,Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial,23,3785
793,4,pos,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.",23,3019
1479,5,pos,The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted,20,2414
743,5,pos,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,23,13
270,5,neu,I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home,23,3516
507,3,neg,It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn’t play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services,23,243
3026,3,neu,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. ",11,1589
882,5,pos,The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.,23,452
3180,5,pos,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,11,3748
3010,5,pos,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",11,2230
172,4,pos,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible,23,737
1108,4,pos,"I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn't do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus.",20,824
252,3,pos,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out.",23,1860
1269,5,pos,my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present,20,3480
754,5,pos,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better,23,3771
123,4,pos,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.",23,2489
1274,5,pos,"Easy to set up, easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great!",20,791
521,3,neu,Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone,23,3039
1165,5,pos,Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.,20,3680
1352,5,pos,Fun item and helpful to do things around the home.,20,2370
929,5,pos,"Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item.",23,1735
1515,5,neu,Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home.,20,1297
1081,4,pos,The Amazon - Echo Plus is good buy it buy it you will love it,20,3165
1389,4,pos,"Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google's, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints.",20,2616
1036,4,pos,Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great.,20,3315
3003,5,pos,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",11,513
1244,5,pos,Sound quality is very good & Sleek design is nice.,20,3608
849,5,pos,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!",23,1760
1083,5,pos,We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning,20,3199

1421,5,pos,We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she‚Äôs been great!,20,278
991,4,pos,I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as ‚ÄúAlexa turn off lights in bedroom‚Äù . Overall she‚Äôs amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events,20,2476
983,5,pos,"bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts.",20,356
631,3,pos,"The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement",23,2600
531,5,pos,A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.,23,2218
1268,5,pos,Definitely worth the money. The sound is awesome!!,20,771
658,4,pos,"Yes, it’s a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I’m hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.",23,1797
841,5,pos,I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.,23,1303

866,3,pos,"We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun",23,3346
288,5,pos,This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated!,23,118
1216,5,pos,"This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more.",20,579
1519,4,pos,"The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though.",20,2723
615,5,pos,"The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo.",23,2539
1177,4,pos,"Speaker has great sound and it’s awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasnt too sure of, but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more. It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub.",20,1414
608,5,pos,"Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them.",23,2817
701,5,pos,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!,23,68
232,5,pos,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!",23,2095

498,5,pos,I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one.,23,75
1279,5,pos,Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house.,20,629
610,4,pos,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking.",23,2166
899,5,pos,The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echos. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music.,23,2373
585,5,pos,Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome,23,1153

1148,5,pos,"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs.",20,1378
451,5,pos,Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things.,23,2024
3200,5,pos,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,11,3696
730,5,pos,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.,23,2638
1495,5,pos,"This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus. It can be turned on and off and also dimmed. The echo Plus is amazing - can play music, control TV and answer many questions.",20,2087
3130,5,pos,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",11,3468
684,5,pos,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.",23,2645
351,5,pos,"This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs",23,3411
456,5,pos,I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it.,23,3104

881,5,pos,The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!,23,90
1451,5,pos,"The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha",20,2552
1112,4,pos,This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product,20,3737
908,5,pos,Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family,23,3519
3146,4,pos,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,11,2197
346,5,pos,Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.,23,2155
903,4,pos,"This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter! If you have Alexa an you like it, a must have upgrade.",23,3132

3104,5,pos,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.,11,207
681,5,neu,As advertised......................................,23,1888
751,5,neu,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!,23,108
1262,5,pos,"received as a Christmas gift. really works well, we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone, so you don't need to remember to plug in a timer when going away. plays amazon music and sound is amazing",20,424
433,5,pos,I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done,23,528
1328,5,pos,I love this product would really recommend to any one!,20,3237
322,5,pos,"Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report",23,2201
1030,5,pos,"Love the sound, I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo",20,3
1529,5,pos,"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.",20,899
733,4,pos,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.",23,3687
3151,4,pos,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,11,1651
2987,5,pos,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.,11,415
1526,5,pos,My first Alexa product and I’m going to say I’ve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome,20,1481
1472,5,pos,I love my Echo Plus!! The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition!!,20,864
1070,5,neg,Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present,20,1836
139,4,pos,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights...",23,294
690,5,pos,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc.",23,670
1293,3,pos,When I tried to hook it up it wouldn't recognize my internet. I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working,20,2383
1312,5,pos,"As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes.",20,877
248,5,pos,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!",23,2029
1531,4,pos,Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings,20,931
818,5,pos,"I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless.",23,2790
458,5,pos,I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.,23,1941
960,3,neg,"I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked.",20,1653
811,5,pos,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.,23,981
290,4,pos,I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next.,23,3793
439,5,pos,"Have not set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better!",23,534
460,5,pos,"This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy",23,2071

1517,5,pos,"Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit.",20,605
1151,4,neu,Great product. Didnt realize its compatible with different items,20,1607
3158,5,pos,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy,11,1391
1388,4,pos,Nice addition to the home but not essential,20,1710
3037,4,neu,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,11,175
294,5,pos,"I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself.",23,2991
236,5,pos,"If youre like me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door",23,3730

890,4,pos,Great product will recommend it to friends and family.,23,2550
688,4,pos,Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product,23,3246
928,5,pos,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),23,2834
1368,4,neu,Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times,20,1525
766,5,pos,Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!,23,2833
1530,5,pos,Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice,20,3466
892,5,pos,The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away,23,1903
228,5,pos,I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!!,23,525
830,4,pos,"a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen!",23,1374

1017,5,pos,Love my Alexa! Having lots of fun asking her questions and enjoy listening to music on it.,20,3014
437,5,pos,"Great video quality, sound/music from a rather small device. Seems well made, entertaining, and more functional as we learn its many features.",23,3325
416,4,pos,"I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this. We also love being able to listen to music, world news, search for items or products and easily order items from this device. We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home. It does so much more. I think this is a great device for the home.",23,397
591,5,pos,I’ve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made.,23,1068
3198,5,pos,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,11,620
736,4,pos,I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information,23,40
557,5,pos,This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display.,23,524
784,5,pos,Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.,23,1741
670,4,pos,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.",23,1377
935,4,pos,"I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven't tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good.",23,226

764,4,pos,I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.,23,542
3097,3,pos,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,11,3479

3073,5,pos,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",11,1063

3186,5,pos,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase!

381,5,pos,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.,23,3079

203,5,pos,"This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. Its not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired.",23,3814

237,5,pos,he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras.,23,672
697,4,pos,"So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.",23,1081
3175,5,pos,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,11,3217
3098,5,pos,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",11,2678

3210,4,pos,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",11,1524
1205,5,pos,I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home,20,2123
600,5,pos,Great product that a whole family would enjoy. Its a perfect addition to the household.,23,3727

1230,5,pos,"This was a gift that I gave to my daughter at our family Christmas party. She loves it, especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights & her nest thermostat. This has also gone over well with the Grand Children.",20,2129
1121,5,pos,"We finally decided to try the Echo system, after months and months of debate. We purchased the Echo Plus & an Echo Dot. The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs. The Plus's speakers are incredible for its size. We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus.",20,2467
1160,5,pos,"Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me. This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely. Love my Alexa, and love the hue bulb. Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!!",20,2972
876,4,pos,"I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.",23,3664
2995,5,pos,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",11,2198
1052,5,pos,"great for the elderly, makes life a lot easier for everyone",20,3728
212,4,pos,"We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well.",23,346
3004,4,pos,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,11,2283
1164,5,pos,Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights.,20,1334
261,5,pos,I love it.. easy to use. Many different features...,23,2289

3066,5,pos,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,11,2412
572,5,pos,I love all my Alexa's I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show. Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family.,23,2946
750,5,pos,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",23,3015
3045,5,pos,Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!,11,3309
547,4,pos,Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound.,23,1348
1162,4,pos,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but Ive read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.,20,1732
3027,5,pos,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",11,2809
178,5,pos,I have the echo and a dot. This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house. Use it every day. I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music.,23,2903

3139,5,pos,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.,11,2611
1201,4,pos,Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo.,20,1726
1317,5,pos,Love operation of this system.Bought the mini afterwards for another room.,20,648
243,5,pos,"I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon......",23,1386

324,4,pos,"I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It's very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts.",23,562
1303,5,neg,"Ive been hesitant to purchase this item, didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need. Alexa has changed my mind. I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances, checking weather and adjusting my heat. Alexa can even arm the alarm system.",20,3289
3143,5,pos,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,11,3290
386,5,pos,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home.",23,1108
3057,5,neu,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate,11,280
3012,4,pos,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,11,3134
627,5,pos,I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.,23,1284
229,2,pos,It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.,23,2051

216,5,pos,This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it.,23,1913

199,5,pos,For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside smart alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!,23,1444
1085,5,pos,Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door. Arming and disarming my security system. If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus,20,3345
3046,5,pos,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",11,2806
