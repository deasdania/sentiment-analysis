0,0,3,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,19,2976
1,1,5,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!,19,3339
2,2,4,"Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark",19,1472
3,3,5,"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",19,603
4,4,5,Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.,19,332
5,5,5,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.,19,753
6,6,5,"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.",19,2421
7,7,4,I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge,19,3388
8,8,5,"amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model",19,3286
9,9,5,"It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though.",19,2849
10,10,5,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.,19,643

15,15,3,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright,19,2413

18,18,5,Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good,19,2902
19,19,4,Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!,19,2964
20,20,1,"I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.",19,1236
21,21,4,This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.,19,1839

28,28,5,I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.,19,3191
29,29,4,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.",19,2022
30,30,4,My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,19,443
31,31,4,"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader.",19,2084

39,39,5,I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful!,19,2059
40,40,5,The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again,19,2902
41,41,5,I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!,19,3774
42,42,5,"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use.",19,81
43,43,5,"The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight.",19,1688

48,48,4,working well and very cheap if we think in the price way,19,509
49,49,4,"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model.",19,3176
50,50,5,"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars.",19,2880
51,51,3,The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading,19,3814
52,52,4,"After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it's going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight",19,3405
53,53,5,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",19,217
54,54,5,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",19,2032
55,55,5,I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark.,19,1181
56,56,5,the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library,19,263
57,57,5,"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.",19,2875
58,58,5,"This is a great way to read books on the go. There's no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it's affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you.",19,2368
59,59,5,"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.",19,1095
60,60,4,i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.,19,989
61,61,5,"We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect.",19,442
62,62,4,"Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too",19,1871
63,63,5,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient,19,3511
64,64,5,I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month,19,626
65,65,5,it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.,19,3483
66,66,5,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",19,1401
67,67,5,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",19,716
68,68,5,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.,19,3306
69,69,4,Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.,19,3714
70,70,1,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,19,2570
71,71,4,My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,19,443
72,72,3,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",19,880
73,73,5,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places.",19,1779
74,74,5,Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.,19,2902
75,75,4,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.",19,1003
76,76,5,"My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003.",19,835
77,77,4,"It's small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you're on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it.",19,2294
78,78,3,This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.,19,2455
79,79,4,"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.",19,2173
80,80,2,it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark,19,2330
81,81,5,"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.",19,2875
82,82,3,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good.",19,1523
83,83,5,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.,19,1638
84,84,4,"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work",19,2177
85,85,4,"I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger.",19,3625
86,86,5,Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where,19,1946
87,87,4,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two.",19,2695
88,88,5,My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.,19,2063
89,89,5,Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.,19,1369
90,90,4,"I love my Kindle! I'm back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn't have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don't get the eye strain like I do when using my phone.",19,2062
91,91,3,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",19,2340
92,92,5,It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.,19,2148
93,93,2,"The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness",19,1018
94,94,5,I should have purchased a kindle sooner. It's easy to use and I love it!,19,2174
95,95,5,This was purchased as a gift and they've absolutely loved it.,19,3281
96,96,5,Great Gift for anyone. Very easy to setup. Coexist with all IOT Devices. Alexa is AWESOME!,23,1266
97,97,5,Super excited to give this as a gift. It's super convenient that Best Buy has Echo products in store instead of having to purchase from Amazon.,23,49
98,98,5,"We bought this for mother in law, buying another for me.",23,590
99,99,5,"Well designed, good sound, has everything Alexa has plus the HD video. Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable. Can show movie trailers, can also watch Amazon video. Excellent on-demand security video with Amazon compatible cameras. Voice activated message and/or video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders. Highly recommended.",23,29
100,100,5,I have one Alexa and three Echo dots and having Echo Show now is awesome!,23,589
101,101,5,Omg I love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff,23,303
102,102,5,Great looking design. Amazon Echo Show was easy to set up and use.,23,448
103,103,5,The product is very entertaining and useful. Would recommend it to anyone.,23,2236
104,104,4,Got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life.,23,3012
105,105,4,This device is awesome ‚Äò really lets you get very excited about smart home technology ‚Äò I‚Äôm buying a second one for my upstairs,23,3128
106,106,5,I purchased this for my daughter and when I tell you she was so happy she hugged the box then me and back to the box!,23,1948
107,107,4,Overall product is excellent. Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo.,23,3294
108,109,5,"I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did! Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that's nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced, and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny.",23,663
109,110,5,"Great product, very much recommended. Service at Best buy is always the best",23,454
110,111,5,"I bought 2 of these for gifts. I love my Echo and think the new one will be incredible too! After the holidays, I will buy one for myself!",23,3550
111,112,5,"I can watch videos, check my security cameras, and grey two for a fantastic price",23,901
112,113,4,"Dreams need topics, song lyrics scroll during song play, watch movies/trailers and etc. With it, if you can get it on sale, bought my for special deal at Best Buy for $129.99. not sure if the value is there at the regular price of$249.99. but it is very cool device.",23,2121
113,114,5,"information on weather, updates on music, events. Fun questions answered while working in kitchen. Good sound for a limited areaGreat sales assistance at Best Buy",23,358
114,115,5,bought for christmas present for son and family so we can communicate visually.,23,2493
115,116,4,"The Amazon echo is excellent. Easy to set up, and we now use it to automate the entire house from our air-conditioning thermostat to every light in the house with the Phillips hue bulbs. We went and got one for everyone in our family.",23,346
116,117,5,"I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking, lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature.",23,3183
117,118,5,"I have only been using my Amazon Echo Show for a couple days now but it works great. The microphone picks up my voice very easily, the sound quality is great, and it looks nice sitting on my coffee table!",23,2159
118,119,5,"this echo show lets you see so much, great item for your home!",23,132
119,120,5,The Echo is very easy to use and has features that allow users to converse easily with others who may have a hard time learning how to communicate using newer videophone technology. This product removes those barriers.,23,2052
120,121,4,I love my echo show I wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon.,23,3086
121,122,5,Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future.,23,2605
122,123,4,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.",23,2489
123,124,5,"It's at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus",23,1162
124,126,5,I have 2 of these in my house work great I just bought 4 for Christmas gifts for my family,23,443
125,129,5,It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this!,23,2937
126,130,4,"I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise.",23,3177
127,131,5,"I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging, my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It's a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time.",23,957
128,135,5,"I love the Echo Show and this is the 3rd one I have purchased (two were presents for family at Christmas). This one was for me. I love being able to hear music, connect with family via video and ask Alexa questions. Best purchase I could have made!",23,2206
129,136,4,"Awesome sound which was unexpected. It's nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes, song lyrics, weather, etc.",23,2168
130,137,4,I love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands.,23,2422
131,138,5,Screen is really nice great for videos I would definetly recommend it,23,3109
132,139,4,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights...",23,294
133,140,5,By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home.,23,487
134,141,5,"Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played!",23,1680
135,142,5,I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product,23,3390
136,144,5,My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit.,23,3169
137,146,5,Replaced a regular echo with this unit. Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price.,23,3085
138,147,5,We love the echo show. Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning.,23,724
139,148,5,"My girlfriend loves the echo show, I bought two of them...",23,363
140,149,5,"Along with fire TV, a prime membership, an amazon music subscription, other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional.",23,754
141,150,5,"It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun!",23,2425
142,151,4,I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in. The quality of the video is great.,23,1793
143,152,4,"Like having another person in the house, I talk to Alexa more then my wife",23,2800
144,153,5,I really love it I use it everyday and it works great,23,1237
145,154,5,We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year. The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit!,23,2111
146,155,5,"The Echo Show is a game changer, it's amazing as are all the Echo's but with this one you can watch video's, or see who's at your door. The things that Echo can do are limitless, it's like having a personal assistant.",23,160
147,156,5,"Another great product by Amazon, super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests.",23,3407
148,157,5,Great product fun to use. Very easy to set up and begin useing,23,1073
149,158,4,Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift.,23,181
150,159,5,Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product.,23,2928
151,160,4,Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub.,23,3145
152,161,5,I live the echo show! So easy to set up and use. I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom.,23,3330
153,162,3,"Alexa may be new, but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges, it should come with better instructions, including what specifically to download into one's device (iPhone, etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one.",23,2637
154,163,5,"I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device!",23,2377
155,164,5,"I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it.",23,2646
156,165,5,Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom.,23,3675
157,166,5,Fantastic product and does exactly as described. Great gift idea!,23,3453
158,167,4,We really like that when you call someone you can FaceTime with them!,23,3688
159,168,5,I bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it!,23,1217
160,169,5,"We love that even our four year old can tell Alexa to ""call papa"" or Alexa turn on the kitchen lights!",23,459
161,170,5,"I find myself saying to my phone, ""Alexa, play........."". I wish they made it for my car too.",23,3121
162,171,5,"Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras. I use it to view our cameras, listen to music, make phone calls/video calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking. I‚Äôve been very impressed!",23,616
163,172,4,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible,23,737
164,175,5,I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it.,23,3433
165,176,4,we enjoy asking it questions about history & educational stuff for kids.,23,3450
166,178,5,I have the echo and a dot. This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house. Use it every day. I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music.,23,2903
167,179,5,What a treat! What‚Äôs the weather forecast? What‚Äôs the news this morning?? Just about all you need to know - plus Smart home control!!,23,2362
168,180,5,I purchased this for my children who are separated by miles. Can't wait for them to open their gifts,23,285
169,181,5,The Amazon Echo Show is a great addition to any connected home. Allows me to link Phillips Hue and Nest systems to control with voice. Great display and available information is awesome.,23,841
170,182,5,Worked as advertised - easy to set up and link to my wi-fi.,23,1394
171,183,4,I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa,23,3600
172,184,4,"I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better",23,2527
173,185,5,Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone.,23,2922
174,186,5,"When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7"" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the ""Front Porch"", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!",23,23
175,187,5,This is actually for a gift. Second one I purchased But great priduct,23,2923
176,188,3,I‚Äôve asked itquestions and answers were unknown and could not help me,23,1598
177,189,5,Great product. Easy to use .very easy to set up ..,23,767
178,190,5,This product is great and a nice addition to the echo family.,23,2016
179,191,5,Connects with Echo Dot and Bluetooth with ease. Works great,23,334
180,192,5,"We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that's not always the case. It's not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it!",23,2672
181,193,5,Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa,23,2009
182,194,4,"At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc.",23,1510
183,196,5,This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature,23,738
184,197,5,I love everything about this Alexa... if you‚Äôre on the fence.. just buy it.. it does everything!!!,23,416
185,198,5,If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you,23,1136
186,199,5,"For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside ""smart"" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!",23,1444
187,200,5,"She is Alexa, better younger sister. Love her, and some of the new skills great",23,2881
188,203,5,"This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired.",23,3814
189,204,5,"It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent",23,3410
190,205,5,I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product!,23,1835
191,206,5,I have been transforming my house to a smart home. So far thus is my favorite. Does so much I learn more each day,23,1320
192,207,4,"The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product. Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions, rather than a simple online manual.",23,1644
193,208,5,I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers.,23,748
194,211,5,no problems so far I'm enjoying it. suggestion : it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers / sound system,23,3784
195,212,4,"We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well.",23,346
196,213,5,This is not my first Echo product - we have 3 Echo dots. This is a step up for us. I have it placed in the kitchen and love it! The sound is outstanding and I love the screen feature. I will be buying additional ones for family as well as myself.,23,726
197,215,4,"almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy, Once in a while it doesn't hear you right but that's probably due to being 10 - 15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems",23,1615
198,216,5,This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it.,23,1913
199,217,5,I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!!,23,418
200,218,4,"We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing.",23,1140
201,219,5,"This is awesome and the sound is amazing, the screen is outstanding",23,1667
202,220,5,"Very neat item, fun to talk to. Easy set up to use.",23,2056

205,223,5,The ease of use and comparability with Smart Home products make a this an awesome product .,23,468
206,224,5,I‚Äôve had Amazon Alexa since she first hit the streets over two years ago and Echo Show is awesome! It can do so much more than Alexa and Echo Dot! You will love it!,23,589
207,225,5,"This is the favorite of the house, even our visitors love it, is amazing!",23,1641
208,227,5,Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information,23,3044
209,228,5,I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!!,23,525
210,229,2,It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.,23,2051
211,230,5,Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup. Video calls to other Show owners works well. Speakers sound good.,23,1139
212,231,3,"THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED.",23,3049
213,232,5,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!",23,2095
214,233,4,I seen one that my son-in-law had and enjoyed using it.,23,990
215,234,5,"I love how I can see my grandkids. I also bought my kids one so they can just ""Drop In"" and I can see them. It also shows words to some songs to sing along. It is fun to have!!",23,784
216,235,5,The best product I have used for AI. Easy set up and easy to use.,23,3264
217,236,5,"If you‚Äôre lik me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door",23,3730
218,237,5,he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras.,23,672
219,238,3,Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated,23,3138
220,239,5,It has been wonderful. I bought it for my boyfriend but I get more use out of it then he does,23,1292
221,242,5,"This is the best assistant from Amazon, with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices!Simply awesome!",23,2134
222,243,5,"I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon......",23,1386
223,245,5,Works great! Now if my dogs would actually answer when I call it would be even better! They‚Äôre just not interested but at least I can see what they‚Äôre doing,23,1493
224,246,5,i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great!,23,1016
225,247,4,"If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.",23,3202
226,248,5,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!",23,2029
227,249,5,"9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can't compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above.",23,1817
228,250,5,Love the many features ! Highly recommend it! using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work... and that‚Äôs amazing!,23,2704
229,251,5,"Used in my home office, gives me all of the information I ask for while my computers are doing other chores. Plays any music that I request, decent quality sound.",23,2788
230,252,3,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out.",23,1860
231,254,5,Great sound and amazing options. Love this!!! Great replacement for original echo,23,2003
232,255,5,I bought this as a gift so I haven't gotten to use it much yet. The initial setup was really easy and I am sure that she is going to love it!,23,1625
233,257,5,"Having 3 amazon echos I had to pick up these to add to more rooms. These work best in the bedroom or kitchen. Video display is bright. Video calling is a great addition and is flawlessly, get them when they go on sale",23,3771
234,258,5,"I have multiple echos and dots but this one is way better. Who doesn‚Äôt like seeing the lyrics of the music, or using video chat with other echo shows. I have two and thinking of getting another one soon.",23,336

236,261,5,I love it.. easy to use. Many different features...,23,2289
237,262,5,"The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself! She will answer questions you ask her, play music on your demand, and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you. I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything I've ever seen in a hybrid tablet product. A must have for your home!",23,1630
238,263,5,it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too,23,2818
239,264,5,Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear.,23,2625
240,265,1,Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn't work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you'll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead.,23,2774
241,268,5,my children loving alexa always talking to alexa every day hehehe,23,3745
242,269,5,Alexa is a great product that can perform tasks and answer all kinds of questions. The Show and its video feature makes it that much more interactive.,23,755

245,273,5,"Love the Amazon Echo Show! The video display is so helpful. Very good quality video and audio sounds better than the Echo Plus speaker. Search a recipe and use it without flipping through recipe books. Need to know a measurement conversion? Just ask Alexa! Learn cooking techniques, recommended cooking times...endless list of available answers. Great addition to my kitchen. LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices. Lots of fun. This works just like all echo products,,,.with smart accessories you can control your home thermostat, lights etc. Alot of expandable options.",23,3278
246,274,5,"Love my new I Pad, and New TV for my kitchenAlso bought 3 Alexa with pods for my family at xmas",23,1442
247,276,5,"I got this as a spur of the moment thing. I figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that it's actually a very helpful device for organizing, shopping, smart home control, listening to music, or even watching some videos while I'm washing dishes. My show is in my kitchen and I've used it for countless things. I think this is amazon's best Alexa yet.",23,3006
248,277,5,Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it! He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday. Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more!,23,3103

256,286,5,"The Echo Show is a great addition to the Amazon family. Works just like the Echo, but with a 7"" screen. Bright vibrant display. Rich clear sound. Works great with Arlo security cameras.

265,295,5,My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other. We love it.,23,2810

I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful. I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She'll get a kick out of it also.",23,213
270,301,5,Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.,23,1582
271,302,5,"Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is ""show"", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do ""drop in"", which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.",23,14
272,303,5,"Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go.",23,3156
273,304,4,"The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as ""play"" or ""start"" or ""open"") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.",23,442
274,307,4,No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6. There is no learning curve for sure. However the camera is better and that is a plus.,23,1086
275,308,5,We have greatly enjoyed using Alexa and having this gadget in our kitchen.,23,3065
276,309,5,"I love the echo show. It is a personal assistant, DJ, weatherman & news person all in one. This is our second Show. We love the video qualties & the sound can't be beat.",23,3770
277,310,5,My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store,23,227
278,311,5,"Wife wanted this gift and it did not disappoint, it's the next step in Amazon's capabilities, adding visual to the sound that was already there.",23,1244
279,312,4,"I had an Alexa, but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it, see videos for info I wanted to look up, play my prime video account. It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime shows/movies on it.",23,442
280,313,5,The echo show works great for home automation. Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features.,23,2934
281,314,4,"Its great, just needs expanding information on it.",23,3110
282,315,5,"We had the Echo (still do, it's just in another room) and purchased the Show. We also have a couple of Dots and have them all set to communicate with each other. As you walk by the Show, it gives mini tips, news, fun facts, etc. Love it! You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show.",23,714
283,316,5,"My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift. Even though I have had an Amazon Echo for a year, I think the Show is much better. The screen takes a lot of the mystery out of what Alexa is doing. Both my wife and daughter love it.",23,1589
284,317,5,"This thing is awesome, great speakers on it too. Go out and grab one",23,3283
285,318,5,"Our 5th Echo Show. We love the Drop In feature, allowing us to use them as an intercom. The ease of playing music on all of them at once throughout the house, and controlled from any device is used daily. The connection to our Sonos system is a real plus. Also connected to our Dish TV receiver.",23,2404
286,319,5,"I love the Echo Show and its many features, great purchase.",23,3588
287,320,5,"I use to communicate with family. I love the drop in feature and it‚Äôs much easier to hear everyone as opposed to FaceTime on speakerphone. It has more to offer, but that is enough for me to recommend for anyone who uses video to keep in touch.",23,707
288,321,5,"Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more!",23,1022

291,324,4,"I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It's very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts.",23,562
292,325,4,The screen really does add tremendous value. The bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago.,23,3673

299,332,5,"It works fast and very clear, speakers sound amazing, looks great in bedroom.",23,1551
300,333,5,"I have several versions of Amazon's Echos - the original, and Echo Plus, 2 Taps and 2 Dots. The Show is the best sounding of the bunch and you have the screen as a bonus. I added a battery pack to make it portable and it's perfect for us.",23,3724
301,334,5,I love it. It does so much and is so easy to use. I use it mostly for music and questions.,23,3357
302,335,5,"I love the Echo show. I have found so many uses such as weather updates, recipes and random questions. My grandkids love it for stories, songs, pictures and just being plain silly. I don't think I've tapped into its full potential yet. I don't think a person can go wrong with this purchase.",23,1787
303,336,4,"Fun and useful, very interactive and still learning all abilities.",23,1064

306,339,5,It has been a lot of fun using in our kitchen. I think we use it much more than we thought we would.,23,2180
307,340,5,Alexa reminds me of all my appointments and it‚Äôs a great tool,23,3578
308,342,5,"Easy to log in and set up. Good sound. Needs a remote for the volume as is changes with each radio station, song, or replies.",23,1106
309,343,4,alexa is awesome and screen makes her even better can't wait to get another,23,2745

311,346,5,Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices.,23,2155
312,347,5,I bought the echo show for my mom for her birthday and she loves it! We use it all the time.,23,1028
313,348,5,"I have a lot of Echos devices. Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker (I have also Google Home devices).The Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen. The screen is bright and sharp, and it's a nice feature to follow recipes, watch videos or even listen to music once the lyrics are displayed on the screen.It's also the best way to see calendar entries, to do and shopping lists.",23,3353
314,350,5,"I am just learning what the Amazon Echo Show will do. I've used it as a timer, I've listened to Iheart radio, I love the smart lights that I bought at the same time. Alexa turns them on/off when I tell her to. When the holiday rush is over, I will go online to learn many more things.",23,2678
315,351,5,"This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs",23,3411
316,353,5,One of my favorite gadgets. It can do so .any things.,23,2823

318,356,5,Best item I ever use. I would love to get another one.,23,20
319,357,4,"Alexa does a lot of fun things but you must enable various apps. She gives funny answers to funny question. However, she is not a complete internet surfer, many things she has no answer.",23,3391
320,358,5,"I bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for Christmas. Not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids, which the one year old loves!",23,474
321,359,4,"Using it in my kitchen. The whole family has access and we can all use different functionality. Great for looking up recipies, music and calling relatives or friends",23,3011
322,360,3,"I got this to work with my Arlo Pro camera, and it works well. I am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command. I hate that I cannot get my Samsung TV to come on with a verbal request. I guess I will have to buy the plug for it. This was very easy to set up. Downloaded the app, and plugged it in, viola it walks you through the setup.",23,1024
323,361,1,"I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago, it isn't the screen provides nothing of value and you can't turn of amazon tips! you have near zero customization can't even move the clock to the other side of the screen. And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm! seriously this is the biggest fail! Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster!",23,3111
324,362,5,Im impressed with it. I can monitory my Arlo cameras at when ever i want and I can treat my Sirius radio,23,676
325,363,4,"Very easy to use and good quality, nice picture and good size for a desk",23,2536
326,364,5,"This Alexa device is great fun, and useful for several personal assistant type applications. I use it in conjunction with some TP-Link Light switches, and it works flawlessly. It is nice to see the lyrics to songs she plays, and calling other people who have the show or spot works well. She is also really good at setting reminders and alarms. Another useful feature is as an in home intercom.",23,684
327,365,5,I Love this I don't even have to turn on my tv I just talk to Alex a and she does what I tell her.,23,3647
328,366,4,Great help from assistants in the store. They were very knowledgeable and took the time to help me choose the right product for my needs.,23,2187
329,367,5,It's nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too.,23,1831
330,368,3,"Its a great product, but for the cost, the speakers are not what they should be, and the screen is too small. Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out. Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem, and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls. Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot. I am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance.",23,1589
331,369,5,"Easy setup for connections to wi-fi cameras, Amazon Digital Subscriptions and coming soon....YouTube. Add your videos and BOOM...to the screen they come.",23,1266
332,370,5,Good for Amazon music and news. Brilliant for controlling lights in the house.,23,2671
333,372,4,"This is an awesome device, but it isn't life changing. It is basically the same as the Echo. I don't use the video much.",23,2049
334,373,5,"Amazing how much stuff this can do everything from a alarm clock to listening to music,asking questions and controlling devices .the sound front the speakers is really great.",23,883
335,374,5,Love this product easy to use and it does so much ch,23,2524

339,378,5,Its an awesome item. Me and the kids love it.,23,1843
340,379,5,Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell.,23,977
341,380,4,Recently divorced I bought 2 of these tonserve as homebase for me and my 8 year old. It has helped him to know there is one spot in both our houses he can reach me by simply saying drop on daddy,23,2641
342,381,5,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.,23,3079
343,382,4,We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me.,23,3541
344,383,3,"I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues.",23,993
345,384,5,Got one for my mom in order to video chat with her. Works awesome.,23,2747
346,385,5,"Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning, the morning commute traffic report. Recipes, facts, phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over, they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money!",23,1866
347,386,5,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home.",23,1108
348,387,5,"Amazing. I seriously didn't know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this), having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes, random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now.",23,2428
349,388,5,"The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos, the security cameras connected to your house, listen to music and watch the baby sleep. I love my Echo Show.",23,1400
350,389,5,"Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price, I couldn't order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product), make video calls to other Show owners, voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won't make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the 'other' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two, disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon's Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a '68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid, ""Easier than fallin' of a log and not near as dangerous.""",23,3689
351,390,4,I purchased this for my husbandHe had been waiting for it for a long timeHe owns Alexa and loved iti do too,23,3540

353,392,4,Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy,23,3365
354,393,4,I love the Alexa system of assistance. This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up. You need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private. I installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use.,23,3787
355,394,5,"The echo show does so much,the music line up is good,it can do anything.",23,1654
356,396,5,Excellent addition to our Amazon components. It is especially better than other versions at hearing varying voices and responding to commands.,23,1590
357,398,5,"Lot to learn, but great device. Connecting to other devices can be frustrating, but over time should be better. Connect to my Bose blue tooth speaker, then tried the dot. Seems connection can be to only one device at a time. Still checking help app but limited info.",23,3636
358,399,5,"I love it, it works great, I love the drop in func.",23,2287

364,406,5,Works great with my Ring doorbell and Ring security cameras. Love that I can see live feeds on my Echo show,23,2825

368,414,5,"A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products. The visuals are amazing, and it is so easy to use and set up.",23,3155
369,415,5,I love my amazon show it‚Äôs a recommended product if you wanna have this item. However the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it‚Äôs full max it may be hard for Alexa to hear you. Another downside google hates amazon = not YouTube.,23,520
370,416,4,"I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this.

375,423,5,"I was hesitant on purchasing this new echo but I'm glad I did. I really like having the feedback on the screen and seeing results in addition to the voice. Using it for weather, recipes and anything that can be displayed is a big help. The echo show responds fairly fast and looks great in my kitchen counter. A definite winner on this one.",23,2512
376,424,5,It did exactly what it's suppose to and I'm still learning new features a month after having it! Very good decice,23,919

378,426,4,"This is my third echo, and the video screen is a nice addition. I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, but not an option. The only thing that's is not as good as my previous ones is that I feel the microphone does not understand me as well. Also, at this point the screen has a lot of potential but not much is implemented yet. (e.g. watch cable tv over internet).",23,2165
379,427,5,"As good as echo, with added visuals can be usefulAnd fun",23,1726

384,432,5,We put in the kitchen for the holidays and used a lot of new recipes Alexa found for us,23,73
385,433,5,I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done,23,528
386,434,5,Got for my parents as a gift. Simple to use and they like it. Got on sale so was good value.,23,1797
387,435,5,I use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere. I use it for a lot of things.,23,1205
388,436,4,Bought my 5 daughters each one for Christmas & one for myself .. love the concept,23,2703

393,441,5,"not a real fan of AI, but Alexa has become quite handy, entertaining, and informative. The Show itself, allows us to contact family that is in Florida and teleconference with them, in 1 simple step.Shows family photos stored in Amazon account.One word, simply AMAZING!!!Bought 1 for my parents, and they USE it!!!",23,1920

399,448,5,This product is great. I wish there was a way to play music from my phone other than Bluetooth only.,23,315
400,449,5,She is not a technical person but enjoys the screen feature and uses it for cooking recipes.,23,2734
401,450,4,It's not open yet it's a bday gift. But I think they will love it,23,3262
402,451,5,Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things.,23,2024
403,452,5,Love it. Does everything I want it to do and more.,23,3565
404,453,5,i loved this product so much i have bought four of them for christmas gifts,23,2904
405,454,5,Long time Alexa user. The video screen just takes it to the next level great product,23,256
406,455,5,"I loved the Amazon Echo, but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing! I highly recommend.",23,1221
407,456,5,I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it.,23,3104
408,457,5,Great and easy to set up. We have this in the hallway and the whole family uses it. Alexa is learning what our family likes each day. My 8 yr old daughter uses it all the time as well.,23,3021
409,458,5,I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven't used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two.,23,1941
410,459,4,This product worked very well and very easy to use.,23,856
411,460,5,"This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy",23,2071
412,461,3,"The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go.",23,446
413,462,5,"Love that I can view my arlo cams on it , love it plays movie trailers on point , love the lyrics when playing music , love the video calls, love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house (they now work as intercoms) so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house (3 story home in Las Vegas ) the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door (arlo cam) then I can say alexa open front door, drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up , Just having a blast with this stuff , yes I am in deep with the smart home thing.. alexa turn on the lights (hue color lights) , turn on the fan (wemo switches) Alexa set house to 77 degrees (nest ) so endless , yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START ...",23,1726
414,463,5,I use this thing every night to fall asleep. Although Alexa don‚Äôt always understand me I still love the device.,23,1362
415,464,5,"Finally decided to try Alexa. Lights, heating, doors, etc... everything is homekit compatible in my house. But this one was too tempting! What a great device. Alexa is years ahead of Siri, great system to have by your bed, and it also controls most of my devices...",23,1841
416,466,3,"The device works well mechanically, however, the software needs a lot of work. Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized.",23,903
417,467,5,"she loves it, got it for her for xmas, we all love to play with it.",23,2498
418,468,5,Love the new video version ! Easy to setup and great to use!,23,2785

421,472,5,Echo show easy to set up. Wish it included the swivel base that is a option now. Love the added video!,23,3069
422,473,5,"Plays any music you request, answers questions, even tells jokes to my 10 yr old. Much more capability than we've unleashed yet!",23,1476
423,474,5,Alexa with screen? LOVE it! Works perfectly with my Ring doorbell.,23,1715
424,475,5,We got this since we have the previous echo and love them. Easy to use and set up. Highly recommend!,23,1773
425,476,5,Its a lot more then we expected.this is a wonderful addition to our tech life,23,3536
426,478,5,"This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot, except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo's this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat, but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well, but you'll probably just watch that on a phone, tablet or TV instead.",23,3225
427,479,5,I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff,23,2257
428,480,5,Just love it. Some very innovative. Very user friendly,23,2826
429,482,5,Bought this for my mom. She thinks it's great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items.,23,2370
430,483,5,The video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices.,23,2336
431,484,5,This amazon echo is most likely the best way to go!,23,3380
432,485,5,A great addition to our home. Kids love it and is vary helpful,23,30
433,486,5,"Got this for my mother who's eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments. She can now video chat with members of the family. Send emails, check her appointments, place phone calls just by requesting it. It has helped her so much.",23,2589
434,487,3,Nice device. Good to enable drop in conversations. Some flash briefings. But overall still a little limited in effective use of video,23,1013
435,489,4,It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube,23,3797
436,491,5,I love the echo show! The only thing I dislike is it doesn't play YouTube videos. Not a deal breaker though.,23,878
437,493,5,"Bought the Echo Show to add on all my smart wifi appliances, wifi video doorbell, smart TV & sound bar, wifi smart lights, wifi smart thermostat, wifi security camera system and so on.",23,1764
438,494,4,"Great overall, would be nice to have parental controls though.",23,3507
439,496,5,I bought 2 shows and I am loving them. Them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized. I don't have to keep my phone on me 24/7 to keep in touch with my closest family members,23,511
440,497,5,Enjoying Alexa! There is so much you can ask her! Looking forward to the security monitoring .,23,1329
441,498,5,I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one.,23,75
442,499,4,Product works well and is fairly simple to operate,23,1210
443,501,5,Like the fact that I can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system.,23,820
444,502,5,"I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phone.They loved it, and feel safer with it. I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help. Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion.",23,3753
445,504,1,qc is really bad on this product and does not catch the voice properly.,23,2202
446,505,5,I didn't expect this device to be so diverse unexpected surprise,23,808
447,506,5,THIS IS AWESOME WE LOVE IT SO MUCH TALK & C PEEPS!!!,23,3223
448,507,3,It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn‚Äôt play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services,23,243
449,508,5,Love this thing. Little apprehensive at first. But Alexa will grow on you,23,1788
450,509,5,"We love our echo show, It‚Äôs fun to use and she can do a lot of things.",23,2558
451,511,5,Too many great things to say about the echo show! I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video. I literally use it everyday multiple times a day. Great product Amazon!,23,3330
452,512,3,"Great sound, easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I've been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I'm just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do.",23,2481
453,513,5,"Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it.",23,3253
454,515,1,"Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest, hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me ""Alexa find videos on f450 drone"" Alexa ""YouTube is not available"". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products, youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet.",23,553
455,518,4,Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work!,23,3251
456,519,5,If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy,23,892
457,520,5,"Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more. Can control lights and various things at the house. Even askes you the question of the day! Easy set up and to use. Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased.",23,1765
458,521,3,Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone,23,3039
459,522,5,Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!!,23,1361
460,523,5,"I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock",23,2817
461,524,5,This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful.,23,324
462,525,4,We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it,23,673
463,526,5,I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful. Would recommend this product and definitely this model. :),23,1433
464,527,4,"We purchased the Echo Show for Christmas this year, and love it so much! Our kids got the hang of it faster than we did (ages 11 and 13)! Highly Recommend!",23,2757
465,528,5,We bought the Amazon Echo Show for my dad. We set up accounts for him to access music and pictures and wrote down a sample list of commands he could use. He loves it. Excellent product. No end to the features you can set up.,23,1963
466,529,5,This device is alot better than the small alexa. Did everything i wanted it to,23,2816
467,530,5,Great amazon device i love these have 2 in my house they are awesome,23,3064
468,531,5,A step up from last year's Echo. Great addition to any part of the room.,23,2218
469,533,5,Was so excited to get this!!! It is so much fun to use.,23,2301
470,534,3,Great product but the only downside is that it did NOT work with my home security camera,23,1754
471,535,4,Great sound and picture. Been using as a baby monitor. Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do,23,438
472,536,3,"The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,""Google is not supported on Echo Show."" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.",23,1173
473,537,5,"Having LOTS of fun with Alexa! Tells us weather, stories, plays music trivia games with us, helps with shopping list, and can face to face talk with my sister in another state (bought one for her too) - great addition to our home!",23,1988
474,538,5,Talk to it and see responses on the touch screen. Love it!!,23,11
475,539,4,"This is a great addition to the Echo family, bringing new and cool features.",23,2665
476,540,5,Great device for music and face time calls. The sound is crisp and clear. Many options with the Echo Show,23,747
477,541,4,Easy to set up. But it does not work with all phones.. I have Samsung 4,23,2769
478,542,5,Easy to set up and use. Useful and fun. The videos make things easy to understand.,23,3056
479,543,5,We bought 2 of them and love them. The screen is really clear and the sound is amazing. Go get one,23,3170
480,545,5,if nothing else I have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then I can now better assist,23,3482
481,546,5,My mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time. She is fun to have around.,23,3422
482,547,4,Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound.,23,1348
483,548,5,love it and it only keeps getting better over time.,23,3414
484,549,5,"Great product, i recommend is easy to use and fast.",23,15
485,550,5,Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device.,23,1952
486,551,5,"The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things. When I was cooking dinner and wanted to finish a show, I was able to ask Alexa to play the show from my Amazon Prime account. The Show was in my kitchen, easy to view, and enabled my kids to watch cartoons in the living room. I love it!",23,678
487,552,5,"Everybody enjoys this product. We use it to show each other things from my home to my daughters in Melbourne, Florida, keep a running shopping list that can be seen just by asking, and for both verbal and visual reminders of events.",23,909
488,553,4,I was unsure if this was worth it before I did. After buying and bringing it home I‚Äôm glad I did. I enjoy being able to video chat threw it!,23,1228
489,554,5,Bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much,23,3604
490,555,5,"Bought for my 88 year old Mom, she loves it, help her with recipes and cooking.",23,811
491,556,5,Enjoy being able to view my Ring doorbell camera in live time upstairs,23,921
492,557,5,This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display.,23,524
493,559,4,"I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it. I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen.",23,465
494,560,4,This is the main reason why I went with Amazon's Echo ecosystem vs Google Home. I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family. My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen. My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor. Huge missed opportunity in my opinion.,23,2727
495,561,3,I'm disappointed. Sometimes gives doesn't understand,23,1993
496,562,5,Echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from,23,1340
497,563,5,"I didn‚Äôt think I would like the Echo Show ‚Äîespecially at the $200+ price point, but I tried it and love it! If I could afford it, and if they would add an audio port, I would replace my current Alexas with Echo Shows.",23,1932
498,564,5,"The Echo Show is a great improvement from the original Echo device. It's great being able to ""see"" what is going on!!",23,386
499,567,4,"This thing is cool, you can do a lot of neat things with the show, hope they add more functionality to Alexa though.",23,656
500,568,5,"We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen. Controls lights , you can FaceTime , my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions",23,3759
501,569,4,"This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There's a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It's fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement.",23,1301
502,570,5,We are enjoying our amazon echo show. Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music!!!!,23,2594
503,571,5,Great device to stay in touch with your family if you leave in another city or state!,23,1197

510,580,4,Great product with cool features! Easy to install! I love the way it looks and feels.,23,2624
511,581,5,"I don't know why I waited so long to bring Alexa into my home. It's how I listen to my music now, dictate my shopping and to-do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few. I highly recommend this item.",23,958
512,584,2,Not sure will be keeping this. Worried about hacks that allow active mic.,23,2396
513,585,5,Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome,23,1153
514,586,4,Love our Echo show. A few enhancements we‚Äôd like to see in future such as ability to load multiple pictures instead of single photo. Can use Amazon photo but we do not prescribe.,23,2547
515,587,4,My whole family loves Alexa. We have the dots in all the bedrooms. I love the smart home features you can add. I love the music offered as a prime member. And when you‚Äôre bored at home she will play games with you or even read you a book,23,1396
516,588,5,Love the echo show. Nice to have a visual. Love the drop in feature!,23,1227
517,589,5,Can use many differents apps from the Echo Show. Awesome product!,23,1433

519,591,5,I‚Äôve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made.,23,1068
520,592,5,"Easy to set up. Plus, the screen is very clear and easy to view.",23,3147
521,593,5,"Not sure I would like this, however, words to songs..Great and ability to view my outdoor and Indoor cameras is a plus. Still learning to use.",23,3566
522,594,4,"Family is having fun with Alexa. I do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home: Arlo, Nest...",23,2607
523,595,5,Life amped! The features of this device have added a new dimension to our everyday routines. Pertinent and usable information by just simply asking. Superb product.,23,739
524,596,5,Alexa show is easy to navigate. It‚Äôs wonderful having so much information at your finger tips.,23,1511
525,597,5,"I already the Echo Dot and saw Amazon advertising for the new show over the summer. Got it as a gift and personally I love it. The speakers and sound from it are great. Plays the lyrics for any songs you have going, so you can karaoke without sucking now. Also displays the time, since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room. Very easy to interact with!",23,550
526,598,4,I really enjoy using Alexa even watch videos utube many things it's worth buying,23,902

529,601,5,Great sounds! Works great with Ring doorbell and nest cameras as well! :),23,2546
530,602,5,"We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents, its ease of use is ideal for them, no computer knowledge needed, speak and they can connect with us.",23,309
531,604,5,I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product,23,1689
532,605,5,You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase.,23,2690
533,606,5,Amazing. Voice recognition great at long distances. Amazon music great! Cant say enough good!,23,2144
534,608,5,"Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them.",23,2817
535,610,4,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking.",23,2166
536,611,5,"We use it to talk to our granddaughter, play games, listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work! Awesome device! We already bought one for our kids also!",23,518

539,615,5,"The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo.",23,2539
540,616,5,"I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it!",23,1163
541,617,5,"The show is our new best friend. We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time. And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off screen‚Äù",23,2386
542,618,5,"this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though I have a prime membership, all music is not available , I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though I upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it.",23,2102
543,619,5,Love it . Easy to use. No problems setting it up!!!!,23,3561
544,620,4,"Very impressed; set up a little confusing, but overall a good experience. Still learning. However, Best Buy emails give away any gift secrets !! Had to reset my account to a work email address.",23,1260
545,621,4,"Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products. The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen, displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard.",23,3801
546,622,5,So easy to set up. Still learning what she can do. Happy so far.,23,180
547,623,5,I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality.,23,1160
548,625,5,easy setup and we can now talk to each other and see each other very easy. great way to keep in touch without a computer.,23,2135
549,627,5,I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.,23,1284
550,628,5,Bought for sons & family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live .. love it,23,1620
551,629,5,It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside.,23,1785
552,630,4,"This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google's version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to.",23,2520
553,631,3,"The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement",23,2600
554,632,5,"Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it!",23,574
555,633,5,Alexa is now a family member. How have I lived my life without her I have no idea...........,23,1847
556,634,4,Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial,23,3785
557,635,5,Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather,23,837
558,636,5,This is a fantastic item & the person I bought it for loves it.,23,935
559,638,5,"It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn't play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos.",23,39
560,639,5,"The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app,",23,2584
561,641,5,I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing!,23,157
562,642,5,"This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it's great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it's random invitations to ""try"" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con's that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can't differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home.",23,1553
563,643,5,"This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product.",23,280
564,644,5,Works well. Haven't been able to work out the local traffic yet.,23,396
565,645,5,Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more.,23,1527
566,646,5,I bought this as a gift for my daughter's 22nd birthday and she totally loved it. Now she's wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor. She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other. I think it was a great purchase so I think I'm going to have to buy another one.,23,1811
567,647,4,Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product,23,220
568,649,5,"Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren, Works great and easy to use",23,1495
569,651,3,"It's neat. It does what all other amazon alexis' do, but a little more. I feel as if should still do more.",23,1225
570,652,5,This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting.,23,897
571,653,5,Thoroughly enjoy my new show. Love the scrolling pictures.,23,1339
572,654,5,I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of B&W 700 Series 2 speakers. WOW...It sounded like Etta James was right in the room! Fantastic!,23,3317
573,655,4,Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes.,23,2468
574,656,4,Love the look- love the size- love that it is VISUAL!!,23,1174
575,657,4,I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor.,23,1665
576,658,4,"Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though.",23,1797
577,659,5,Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well.,23,3425
578,660,5,Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products,23,3176
579,661,5,"Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music!",23,3572
580,665,4,"Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you.",23,1234
581,666,5,"Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it",23,198
582,667,5,This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal.,23,1182
583,668,5,The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless.,23,581
584,669,4,"I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets, our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it's hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we're happy with the purchase.",23,1214
585,670,4,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.",23,1377
586,671,5,"Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great.",23,2900
587,672,5,Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights,23,2200
588,674,4,loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use.,23,828
589,676,5,I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms.,23,1455
590,677,4,"I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too.",23,1765
591,678,5,"Is better than face time when calling my kid, since they have one, IÔ∏è could call them from my and see them at the same time, perfect for cooking timer n best for music",23,657
592,681,5,As advertised......................................,23,1888
593,682,5,I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information,23,492
594,683,5,I am enjoying the Echo Show a lot.Very entertaining,23,1193
595,684,5,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.",23,2645
596,685,5,"Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices",23,3570
597,686,4,I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa.,23,1393
598,687,5,"Easy to install, very easy to use, we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time",23,2563
599,688,4,Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product,23,3246
600,689,5,"We have the original Echo, two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family - love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome!",23,177
601,690,5,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc.",23,670
602,691,5,I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa.,23,644
603,692,5,"Our whole family loves, and uses this device for so many different features. We love using it to make phone calls, watch films, play Jeopardy, even to define words as they come up in conversation. We definitely get a lot of use out of this device, more than any other screen, tablet, or smart phone device we own.",23,238
604,693,4,"FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA""""""""""""""""""""""""""""",23,331
605,694,5,"A nice ""next step"" in the Alexa repertoire; easy to set up and to use.",23,2607
606,695,4,It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function.,23,361
607,696,5,I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions.,23,1357
608,697,4,"So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.",23,1081
609,698,5,"this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information, love this product",23,2736
610,699,5,Simply love it! It‚Äôs loud... love watching videos!!,23,1070
611,700,5,This product is amazing. I do however wish that there were more video features on it!,23,740
612,701,5,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!,23,68
613,703,3,"This item seems great on the ads, but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù, some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed, but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful, but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain.",23,2963
614,705,5,Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children's families during this holiday season!,23,3148
615,706,5,"With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven't used this feature yet since I'm the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life.",23,480
616,707,5,Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas!,23,2182
617,708,5,Got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc√© and they love it. Works great with Phillips Hue,23,1901
618,709,5,"I love this new Alexa device with the screen. I bought it for my mother who really couldn't ""relate"" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too!",23,3741
619,711,5,We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite!,23,2313
620,712,5,"Nice to see songs, and many other items. Shows words to music, can watch u tube. And video calls.",23,807
621,713,5,Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about,23,3769
622,715,4,I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better,23,1691
623,716,5,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly.,23,36
624,717,5,Bought it for my son & wife. They love it. Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it. They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful.,23,526
625,718,5,Very impress with the echo show and all of its features,23,402
626,719,5,I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line.,23,1054
627,720,5,"This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw!",23,1855
628,721,4,Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation.,23,2796
629,722,4,The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be.,23,379
630,723,4,"If Amazon and Google can work things out, the Show will be amazing! We already loved the Echo and the Dot, and were looking forward to adding video. Unfortunately, YouTube is no longer on the Show, limiting the video content. If they can ever get it back, the Show will definitely be a 5 star product!",23,277
631,724,5,"The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show.",23,2335
632,725,5,I love this product! The possibilities are endless!,23,2569
633,726,5,It's great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend,23,102
634,728,5,"Absolutely Awesome! Great product, recommend that Everyone have one!",23,1059
635,729,5,"Traded my original echo for echo show. Glad I did, screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices.",23,986
636,730,5,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.,23,2638
637,731,5,I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn't liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon.,23,1084
638,732,5,Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis.,23,3699
639,733,4,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product.",23,3687
640,734,5,Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year.,23,2096
641,735,5,This is the most amazing item. And very easy to use,23,208
642,736,4,I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information,23,40
643,737,5,Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon. Now my fam is all connected.,23,1318
644,738,5,"bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)...",23,1988
645,739,4,"We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around.",23,74
646,740,3,"Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube.",23,2996
647,741,5,"Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights, alarm, vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists, keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.",23,2513
648,742,4,"We're still learning all the things this device can do. So far, We're very pleased.",23,1863
649,743,5,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,23,13
650,744,5,We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition. We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features.,23,2005
651,745,5,Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use,23,3028
652,746,4,"I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation.",23,3198
653,747,5,Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,23,1889
654,748,5,Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.,23,1837
655,749,4,This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house.,23,2713
656,750,5,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",23,3015
657,751,5,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!,23,108
658,752,5,"This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product",23,179
659,753,5,I couldn't believe how easy and fast the setup was. It's basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don't need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose.,23,3626
660,754,5,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better,23,3771
661,755,5,"The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. .",23,711
662,756,5,Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.,23,1315
663,757,5,"We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!",23,3495
664,758,5,I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time,23,1904
665,759,5,"Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it",23,1585
666,760,5,Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo.,23,365
667,761,4,"Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great.",23,1614
668,762,5,This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.,23,3350
669,763,5,"Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago",23,230
670,764,4,I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.,23,542
671,765,5,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale.",23,3157
672,766,5,Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!,23,2833
673,767,5,"After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices.",23,1376
674,768,5,Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day.,23,1078
675,769,5,"I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.",23,2220
676,770,4,I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv.,23,1528
677,771,4,This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.,23,226
678,772,5,Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line.,23,1407
679,773,5,"Once you have it, you can't live without it. Great product.",23,585
680,774,5,The show works great with my other products. Love it,23,3698
681,775,5,Love the echo show & the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones.,23,594
682,776,5,The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone,23,2715
683,777,3,All I really use it for is music. The read downfall is it‚Äôs not Bluetooth so it has to be plugged in 24/7,23,3208
684,778,5,I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything . I love it!,23,1766
685,779,5,We're hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc.,23,1747
686,780,5,"So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product!",23,3187
687,781,5,I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends,23,3222
688,782,5,I can see my grandchildren when I call it is a great machine,23,1027
689,783,5,Love the screen and being able to see video along with my cameras on my Vivint smart home,23,2574
690,784,5,Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.,23,1741
691,785,5,Amazon built upon the success of their Echo. I'm really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display.,23,997
692,786,4,I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices.,23,1021
693,787,2,Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly.,23,2793
694,788,5,The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .,23,3175
695,789,5,"The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun! I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself! We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines. This show is so much fun! We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee, it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights, we listen to music while cooking dinner... cant recommend it more! Because of this purchase, I am also buying a spot! We love the camera feature where you can ""drop in"" so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras (for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog).",23,2161
696,790,5,Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show,23,3734
697,791,5,I‚Äôve always loved the amazon Alexa smart products and use them to control my smart home setup.,23,1534
698,792,5,Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling.,23,521
699,793,4,"Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too.",23,3019
700,794,5,"I use the echo show to stream music, video chat, and drop in as a camera from my home. You can even see recipes and other items. Worth the money, got it on sale! I always wait for sales.",23,2467
701,795,5,"at first I wasnt sure if this was something I ""needed"" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I ""needed"" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone.",23,2097
702,796,5,Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember.,23,2342
703,797,5,"I control all my smart home sthings with it, and also have 2 echo dots",23,3676
704,798,5,"I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE",23,1930
705,799,5,I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.,23,2563
706,800,5,With a Seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family.,23,3810
707,801,1,"Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.",23,3242
708,802,5,"I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol",23,1356
709,803,4,The Alexa show is a great product and the price was even better,23,2746
710,804,5,"I‚Äôm all about the smart home and I love my new echo show. I stay more connected with my family. I also love how it‚Äôs integrated with my Arlo, Ring, Nest, and Hue light bulbs.",23,879
711,805,5,"Love this! We have it on our kitchen counter and great for music, news updates, amazon delivery updates, recipes, timer, and soo much more!",23,1289
712,806,5,Tech is not totally friendly but for The cost and what it does it is worth the investment,23,3469
713,807,5,Great product and it is very easy to set up and use,23,208
714,808,4,"Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know?",23,776
715,809,4,"Works well with smart home lights, door locks and wireless security cam",23,1956
716,810,4,Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.,23,1876
717,811,5,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.,23,981
718,812,4,"I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.",23,474
719,813,5,I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product!,23,3757
720,814,5,It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.,23,1936
721,815,4,"So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad. It's nice when I'm cooking and I need help with a recipe but it can be annoying when my kids fight over what they want Alexa to answer. Over all it's a nice product, connects to my Ring doorbell too which is nice.",23,226
722,816,5,"The Echo show is addictive. Pairs easy, fantastic sound and video and once you download the Alexa app and learn a few things it becomes indispensable. Video calls work well. Great for the office or Kitchen.",23,2248
723,817,4,"I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good.",23,1604
724,818,5,"I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless.",23,2790
725,819,5,"User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool",23,3679
726,820,5,"This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking.",23,955
727,821,4,Echo Show is a great tool in the kitchen. Paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly. Video selection could be better (somehow needs to strike a deal with Google for access to YouTube video). It does have nice video for recipes.,23,3018
728,822,5,"Amazon's Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast",23,3216
729,823,5,"I‚Äôm in love with Alexa. Love her fir music, quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes. It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour.",23,1865
730,824,5,"Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such.",23,2844
731,825,5,"She knows all the answers. I‚Äôm used to speaking to her, i recently visiting a friend and said ‚ÄúAlexa ‚Äú. And my friend looked at me like I was crazy. She doesn‚Äôt have Alexa.",23,3149
732,826,5,It is great to be able to make video calls from the kitchen. Very convenient.,23,1767
733,827,2,Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.,23,1589
734,828,5,This was bought for a gift. But it looks nice. Just what was expected,23,654
735,829,4,I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents. Will see how they like it.,23,3340
736,830,4,"a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen!",23,1374
737,831,5,"with this echo line, we are able to watch amazon prime, and even do visual calls to grand daughter!",23,1434
738,832,5,Great to give as gifts. I bought several items for staff.,23,3756
739,833,5,I have several around the house and love playing music on them,23,273
740,834,5,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything. We love listening to music on it as well.,23,3598
741,835,5,The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well. I also like being able to view news briefings and song lyrics on the screen also. The Echo Show is the only way to go.,23,297
742,836,4,"The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other.",23,342
743,837,4,"I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one.",23,1824
744,838,5,We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot,23,226
745,839,2,"I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....",23,1539
746,840,5,I. Like the visual with this echo although I think I would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa,23,1918
747,841,5,I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure.,23,1303
748,842,4,"We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!",23,3506
749,843,4,"The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.",23,3811
750,844,4,Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!,23,1752
751,845,5,Staff was very helpful and polite ! Went in asked for help and was pointed in the right direction!,23,2496
752,846,4,Absolutely love this. We got the lights and they have worked so great.,23,2207
753,847,5,Great Smart speaker for my 90 year old mother in law.,23,1566
754,848,5,"I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle. You can watch amazon pirime tv,play amazon music. Text, play games read the lyrics while the song is playing. I love it",23,2058
755,849,5,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!",23,1760
756,850,5,Love the new echo show. has so many more features that my echo dot.,23,2683
757,851,5,"I had been looking for the product for a while. After much research, I bought it and I am not disappointed. It is a great product. I can tell I won't be bored learning all that the echo show can do. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it.",23,2688
758,852,5,"The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub.",23,2065
759,853,4,Like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates,23,2029
760,854,4,"It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn't do Netflix, or Hulu, but that's okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It's easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid's goodnight, when I am working late.",23,1507
761,855,5,Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices.,23,1826
762,856,5,I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video.,23,3752
763,857,5,"Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I'm a new customer there",23,3051
764,858,3,The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much.,23,3467
765,859,4,"Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment.",23,3534
766,860,4,Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.,23,703
767,861,3,"Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion).",23,166
768,862,5,We are loving it so far! Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap. We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth! I love how all the echo's connect now in our home.,23,2824
769,863,5,I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.,23,2118
770,864,5,"When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it.",23,2663
771,865,5,Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.,23,458
772,866,3,"We wanted to see how this would work and it's not super accurate, but kind of fun",23,3346
773,867,4,We have Alexa and now a video version of recipes and more. Love it!,23,2431
774,868,5,"Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff, but to be honest Alexa has been great, not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking, or being able to multi task much easier, it fit in seamlessly with our home security system, added a extra cam, and really does add something extra to the home",23,2602
775,869,5,Video integration it's big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who's at the door when doorbell rings.,23,3733
776,870,5,The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up,23,1921
777,871,5,I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine,23,226
778,872,5,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,23,1828
779,873,5,"I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.",23,3489
780,874,4,Added screen a great features visual effect a plus,23,1183
781,875,5,We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews,23,280
782,876,4,"I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.",23,3664
783,877,5,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.,23,1967
784,878,5,"I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn't allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that.",23,689
785,879,5,I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies.,23,1586
786,880,5,I am totally Addicted.Easy to use. Love the call feature.,23,1203
787,881,5,The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great!,23,90
788,882,5,The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise.,23,452
789,883,5,Product is great. It is Easy to use and easy to set up,23,72
790,884,5,"This is a helpful addition to the home. It's great to be able to set timers, play music, and check the news all hands free.",23,648
791,885,4,Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation.,23,1425
792,886,3,"This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen. The sound is comparable to the echo which is good. The screen is small, not hd, and not touch screen. You only can call other echo users.If you have an echo don't run out and buy you can do all on a laptop. If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,",23,1540
793,887,5,Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.,23,3449
794,888,4,Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos,23,938
795,889,5,"First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.",23,2588

802,896,3,"We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa, and home automation. After using for a week, we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn't ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the ""I can't answer that"" response to questions. It's a waste of money for us. Say ""Alexa, Say good bye!""",23,2655
803,897,5,This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo. It provides better sound quality and plays video. Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this product.,23,1148
804,898,5,"Alexa can do it all! Having a severe hearing loss, the 'Show' gives me visuals along with captions so that I can follow what Alexa is saying!",23,1629

821,915,3,"The echo show feels useless after a few hours, especially without the ability to watch YouTube.",23,1479

832,926,5,I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen.,23,1789
833,927,5,Video calls work great and the screen is super informative.,23,467
834,928,5,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),23,2834

I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven't tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good.",23,226
842,936,5,Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!!,23,1113
843,937,4,I own multiple echoes and I like the show the best. The screen adds a lot of value in my opinion. I really like being able to see upcoming calendar events and daily news. My kids like watching cartoons from Amazon Prime while eating breakfast. The speakers are great and put out more than enough quality sound for their size. At $149 it was a great deal.,23,1789
844,938,5,I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter !,23,86

864,958,5,Alexa walks you through every step which I found helpful.,20,3786
865,959,5,We have sonos speakers and a Honeywell Lyric thermostat. It took a little searching on google to get things linked. Now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using Alexa.,20,276
866,960,3,"I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked.",20,1653

877,971,5,"I originally purchased this to use as a Bluetooth speaker for my wife's music but soon realized that we would use this much more than we thought. Ya, turning on and off lights is good and being able to dim with the included bulb is pretty great but there are hundreds of smart home type of apps that work with this including my Sony Google TV and more show up regularly. Makes it almost too easy to be lazy.",20,1350
878,972,4,Pretty fun little gadget. Kids love playing with it. Not even sure of all the things it can do yet,20,1262
879,973,5,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.New toy!,20,2740

889,983,5,"bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts.",20,356
890,984,4,Echo is nice but it could be better allowing you to connect to anything that is on your WIFI network without having to buy several different hubs.,20,700
891,985,5,I need to buy all the additional parts but it‚Äôs great,20,2169
892,986,5,I have enjoyed learning about home automation using Echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of Alexa.,20,3176
893,987,5,I love this product! I love everything about it!!!,20,3419
894,988,5,I have two dots and this and the functionality between them is awesome. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves through time. Great quality speaker and build.,20,1130

906,1000,5,This is such a great addition to our house! Amazon Echo plus is incredible for all the things it is capable of doing.,20,437
907,1001,4,"We use Alexa to ask simple questions like - what time is the basketball game? and she usually responds correctly. If you ask a more detailed question, she may not have an answer. We like to play Jeopardy and listen to local radio stations using Alexa. I am sure the device will get better with more use and updates.",20,3472
908,1002,5,"Decided to go for the model just below this one. I didn't need the integrated ""hub"" features. (Phillips Hue does require this, but I decided to stick with my current Insteon hub).",20,715

916,1010,4,"Good stereo sound, but will not control some devices without the use of an external hub.",20,1910
917,1011,5,Easy to use no Complains at all. Added all the smart plugs to the skills and works perfect.,20,671

982,1076,5,"So yesterday evening i decided to purchase an Amazon Echo. Is the machine intrusive yeah i guess it could be if you allow it. I purchased it because of its home automation and other fantastic capabilities. Just to name a few of those capabilities. With a subscription you will have an unprecedented amount of music you can listen to, that in itself was worth it. Some other things include sports travel recipes and traffic. The home automation part lock doors turn on lights random lighting when on vacation..",20,793
983,1077,5,"We love Alexa! Great addition to our family! Lol But seriously, you can rely on Alexa....",20,3473

990,1084,5,Great item and easy to use. Very helpful and entertaining,20,1671
991,1085,5,Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door. Arming and disarming my security system. If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus,20,3345
992,1086,5,Received an Echo Plus as a Christmas present. Absolutely love it. We went back & purchased a Dot & more light bulbs.,20,1819

1000,1094,5,"The Echo Plus was demonstrated for us at Best Buy. We were a bit skeptical but bought to check it out. Wow! are we impressed! We tell it to turn on and turn off our lights in the living room, family room, and bedroom. Also it can dim the lights more than once. Need the local weather forecast, just ask. Want to listen to Christmas music? Yes, again. Want to know the distance to someplace or the population of some city or country, yes! We're still discovering what it can do and it seems limitless. Absolutely love this!!",20,1664

It is a great device. I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house, especially when they are upstairs, without having to yell. The smart hub is amazing. Attaching to smart devices is much more seamless than with the 1st gen echo. Just got it so time will tell, but the 2nd gen Echo devices are worth it.",20,3491

1040,1134,4,I purchased my Eco for the holidays. It took me considerable time to get minimally operational. It is rather complex to hook up to other devises. So far it is only hooked up to my Dot. I wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it. I am not nearly able to make use of it yet. But...it does look exciting if I ever get there.,20,2260
1041,1135,5,The built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices. The larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice!!,20,903

1044,1138,4,"I really enjoy the sound. It sounds so full. My only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub. I had to purchase the Hue Hub to get full functionality. Other than that, I love it.",20,2308

1065,1159,5,"When I used to think of amazon echo I think flimsy sounds, Amazon Echo was more of ECHO-Ing, tin can complex... at least from what I have experienced with my friends echos. Echo Plus you ask... Not so much!!! This device has such excellent sound!! One of the best devices I have ever purchased! If I could I would have these all over my house. Forget the dot and the echo 2nd gen. Echo plus is the way to go!!! Beautiful device, sounds is second to none!",20,2295
1066,1160,5,"Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more!

1067,1161,4,"Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn't lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for 'free' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects.",20,975
1068,1162,4,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but I‚Äôve read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.,20,1732

1071,1165,5,Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.,20,3680
1072,1166,4,The system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions. It even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly.,20,2955
1073,1167,4,Got one for my daughter last year and she loves it.,20,2372

1078,1172,2,I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light. I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt.,20,1145

1084,1178,4,This is my second Alexa and the second time set up so much easier. I love the extra volume for my music and the peer to peer calling gives me a mini hands free intercom. Still discovering the new features.,20,2467

1102,1196,5,"I like being able to ask about the weather, set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking Elexia.",20,2055
1103,1197,5,"From her jokes, rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome. Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day. But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week. There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random. But shes a must try. Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces. You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs.",20,3113
1104,1198,4,You need to have Amazone prime in order to have music,20,2710
1105,1199,5,Works great. Can‚Äôt wait to find all it can do for me.,20,308
1106,1200,5,Asking trivia questions of Alexa is a hoot but being able to turn off the ceiling fan from bed is golden.,20,3610
1107,1201,4,Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo.,20,1726
1108,1202,5,Great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone,20,2831
1109,1203,5,I really like this product. My Son got us the Alexa Show for Christmas and I wanted one that would turn on lights and other items. So we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the Phillips Hue lights. It works great. I have the Show in the kitchen and I have the Echo in my bedroom. I love that it has a great built in speaker. I can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time.....,20,3643
1110,1204,5,Bought for a family memeber and he was so happy with the game,20,3520

1115,1209,5,"I was skeptical about the Amazon Echo products. Why would I need this? I bought the Echo Dot first and was hooked. Bought this Echo Plus for smart home integration. Since then, I have bought a bunch of smart bulbs and plan on more ""things"", I bought an Echo Spot, too. You do not need an Echo product, but they are fun, practical and cool. Can't live without it now!",20,3331
1116,1210,4,A fun little device on the cutting edge of consumer artificial intelligence. Sp aker sounds pretty good. Alexa does have some problems understanding how I ask questions a fair amount of the time.,20,3526

It's easy to setup, too.",20,1350

1141,1235,5,I received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office. This year I decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features I hadn‚Äôt taken advantage of. Primarily the smart home features. This was great because it came with a lightbulb.,20,1211

1228,1322,5,"Bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it. Makes her feel like she is a tech wiz. Makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes. More importantly, she is in her 70s and Iives alone, she can make a phone call using Alexa from anywhere she has an echo. I bought her 3 to cover her whole house.

1252,1346,5,As advertised. Easy set up and integration. Haven't tried to use the hub yet but it is limited in the number of products it works with compared to Samsung Smartthing or Wink 2.,20,3411
1253,1347,5,Love the bigger speaker and the quality of sound with this product. Like turning on bedroom light with Alexa.,20,3333
1254,1348,4,"I usually unplug it but when I plug it back in, it is always difficult to get it reconnected to the internet for some reason.",20,992
1255,1349,5,I purchased this to pair with my other echo while I enjoy my other 2 echoes I must say there is a noticeably difference with the echo plus and best buy had it at a remarkable price better than amazon so it was win they amped up the speaker,20,1834

1262,1356,4,"Like the idea of having a built-in hub to control other smart home devices as we get them.Sound quality is marginally better, but we didn't buy Echos as audiophiles...but for background music and it's perfect for that.My only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and Amazon Echo must have one or the other. That makes it frustrating for the other user (particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms).",20,1770

1264,1358,5,Echo plus is able to play music and response whatever answer by itself. It also equip with bluetooth so I can pair to another more powerful speaker.

1284,1378,5,Very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music.,20,1842
1285,1379,5,I‚Äôve been using the Amazon Echo from the day it was released to the market. Unfortunately the volume control wheel broke.

1330,1424,5,"Friend received Amazon Echo as gift & is enjoying it. I researched & decided on Echo Plus as I wanted capability to use to control home lighting. Absolutely love this product! It controls lights in several rooms as well as outdoor lighting. Other features, weather, news briefs, traffic are fun, but the lighting control did it for me.",20,2319
1331,1425,5,"Amazon and Philips Hue work great together. very easy setup. The only drawback is using these bulbs on a non-Philips dimmer switch. The bulbs flicker a bit, even when it's set to full on",20,2865
1332,1426,5,"This is a neat little toy. It‚Äôs pretty cool that I‚Äôm able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa.",20,1039

1338,1432,5,super cool very interesting i have a lot of fun with it,20,63
1339,1433,5,I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service.,20,2817

1346,1440,5,This doesn't require separate speakers and has great sound,20,968
1347,1441,5,Love this thing ! I have linked it to my Hue System and my Fire TV. I ask her and she does it. Fun to play games also. My wife was sceptical but now she uses it more than me,20,2817

1357,1451,5,"The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha",20,2552
1358,1452,5,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife so I haven't used it yet. We do have several echo dots and we love those. With it coming with hue light bulb that's an added bonus,20,2496

1366,1460,5,Love how it hooks up to lights. And can play any music,20,1161
1367,1461,4,Alexa is easily confused and fun to mess with but also informative when we are being serious. She disappoints when she loses connection with the wifi,20,1922

1410,1504,5,We love this whole system!!! Easy to use and very useful!,20,1617
1411,1505,5,This product works great. I really enjoy having Alexa follow commands,20,3429
1412,1506,5,Other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has. It is superior to all the others.,20,2878
1413,1507,5,I brought the Echo Plus for the louder sound quality. I already have an Echo Dot which I use in my bedroom to control my lights and heater via a Wemo Smart Switch. I brought the Echo Plus which I use in my family room for music and to control my smart devices.,20,1445
1414,1508,2,"HUB is almost useless. Ended up using spare Philips HUB. The HUB built in would only ""discover"" 2 out of 12 bulbs. 3 days of trying. HUE bridge 12 out of 12 first try.",20,371
1415,1509,5,"Love this device, performs perfectly! Plays music and lures lights off and on by command.",20,1273
1416,1510,5,love all the fun things you can do with Alexa. And she's learning more everyday!,20,330
1417,1511,5,Bought this for my parents' home and it's awesome. The quality of the sound is amazing. It's also helpful to get quick questions answered when they're running around or out of the house. I need to now purchase one for my own apartment. Also great when hosting guests.,20,2409
1418,1512,4,Can not tell you the price of merchandise when asked.,20,323
1419,1513,5,It is nice to have access to the features this offers.,20,1448
1420,1514,5,I know this makes us lazy. But comes in handy when your hands are tied up with groceries or holding a baby. Love that my kids ask her questions.,20,3195
1421,1515,5,Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home.,20,1297
1422,1516,5,So many things you can use it for! Love working my lights.,20,3227
1423,1517,5,"Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit.",20,605
1424,1518,4,Exchanged the google Google home for this model. Fun for the kids. Finding new uses for it every day. Had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb.,20,1808
1425,1519,4,"The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though.",20,2723
1426,1520,5,Love the sound I am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated!,20,3507
1427,1521,5,"This product is amazing! I wasn't quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one, but now that it's in my house I cannot imagine life without it. Alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information, but now she controls the lights of my house for me! I highly recommend this!",20,889
1428,1522,5,I have the original Echo and just purchase the Echo Plus. Better speakers and can act as a hub for the Philips Hue Bulbs without having to purchase another hub. Very satisfied with its performance.,20,190
1429,1523,4,Easy setup. They are adding new commands every week it seems. Still has some work till it is fully functional.,20,3634
1430,1524,3,They make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to Alexa but she never knows anything. It is very non responsive at times too.,20,2945
1431,1525,4,"It‚Äôs fun for the family to play with, but it may get boring after the newness wears off. We‚Äôll see.",20,3808
1432,1526,5,My first Alexa product and I‚Äôm going to say I‚Äôve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome,20,1481
1433,1527,5,"Great and fun , almost like having someone in the room with you",20,226
1434,1528,5,"I love the Alexa. It has encouraged me to automate my home. Now I have lighting that comes on when I ask, My heat is controlled wherever I am and it's fun asking her (Alexa) questions.",20,3176
1435,1529,5,"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.",20,899
1436,1530,5,Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice,20,3466
1437,1531,4,Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings,20,931
1438,1532,5,Alexa rocks. The Echo Plus is super easy to set up. I works great. Love everything about it. Adding more devices.,20,1087

1446,1540,5,Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!,3,226
1447,1541,3,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/,3,2543
1448,1542,5,"Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up.",3,2307
1449,1543,5,Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package,3,3216

1455,1549,5,"After purchasing 2 different ""brand X"" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price!",3,708

My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.",16,664

I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price",7,1565
1566,1668,5,Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!,16,475
1567,1669,5,We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child.,16,162
1568,1670,5,The product is very durable and is great for children,4,3579
1569,1671,5,"Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.",4,1399
1570,1672,5,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.,9,1638
1571,1673,5,Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts,9,848

1576,1678,5,Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.,4,2817
1577,1680,3,It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.,16,3544
1578,1681,5,"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks",16,1570

1580,1683,5,After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.,16,656

1611,1716,5,"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old.

1616,1721,5,"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied.",16,2674
1617,1722,5,"This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced.",16,1658

1623,1728,4,Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.,6,196
1624,1729,5,I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.,16,2987
1625,1730,5,"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps",16,2369
1626,1731,3,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.",4,3497
1627,1732,4,"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it",16,942

1630,1735,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",6,1443
1631,1736,5,"My wife loves to read, but she was always hesitant to try ebooks. She used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book. I talked her into it by telling her its lighter, easier to hold, can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it. But she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back. She also found out that Amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing, namely classics and such...I think. If you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version. The LED's are a nice touch.",9,3302
1632,1737,3,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok",7,2025

The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned.",16,2288
1757,1865,5,"I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free.

1768,1876,5,"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.",4,3484

It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week.",16,226

1817,1927,3,"I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+.",16,434

I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this.",9,756

1849,1960,3,"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls",7,1744
1850,1961,5,"Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!",16,2711
1851,1962,4,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.,6,2100
1852,1963,4,"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid.",16,821

1857,1968,5,I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.,16,3323
1858,1969,5,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.",16,117

1899,2014,5,I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.,16,641

1919,2035,4,I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.,16,1285

The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable",4,768
1924,2041,4,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.",16,149

1929,2046,4,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.",16,1413
1930,2047,5,Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product,4,1123

I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.",16,651
1947,2064,5,"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.",16,1354

I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.",6,650

It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",6,623

However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine.",7,1923
2089,2210,4,"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it.",4,3409

2158,2280,2,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc.",16,1574
2159,2281,3,"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price.",7,3139

Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.",7,1512

I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.",4,3074

I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.",16,1346
2200,2322,4,"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps.",16,3230

2211,2333,5,The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.,16,1432
2212,2334,5,i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe,16,1603

2239,2362,4,Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.,7,2999
2240,2363,5,It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device,16,1236
2241,2364,4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",6,2155

2246,2369,5,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional.

Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent.",9,3752

2261,2384,5,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!",9,1937
2262,2385,5,"It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!",16,2871
2263,2386,4,I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.,7,3808

2269,2392,5,"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,",16,2442
2270,2393,4,Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.,4,2247
2271,2394,5,The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.,16,2314

2276,2399,2,"After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg",7,2874
2277,2400,4,"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!",16,1650
2278,2401,5,"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.",9,2875

2283,2406,5,Great product and great service from bestbuy online,16,3100
2284,2407,5,"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up.

Lots of good educational apps and games.",16,3215

2288,2411,3,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.",16,26
2289,2412,3,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.,16,2219

2291,2414,4,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.",7,1413
2292,2415,5,Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.,9,2164

2308,2431,1,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.,4,949

2315,2438,4,"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store.",4,530

2327,2451,3,"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful",16,2906
2328,2452,5,"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it.

2331,2455,5,My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!,16,3205
2332,2456,5,I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!,6,1042
2333,2457,5,I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.,10,2993
2334,2458,4,It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.,4,2119
2335,2459,4,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones",16,413

2341,2465,5,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",9,716
2342,2466,3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,7,1371
2343,2467,5,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.,4,503

2360,2484,1,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",7,2882

2369,2493,4,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.,16,3546

It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product.

I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it.",4,324

2508,2633,5,Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where,9,1946
2509,2634,5,"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.",16,373

2516,2641,2,It's a good device for children because they don't know any better,4,3652
2517,2642,4,"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network.

2532,2657,3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,16,1371

2561,2687,5,"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it.",9,2675
2562,2688,4,Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.,7,304
2563,2689,5,This is the best purchase I've mad in a tablet my daughter loves it,7,3727
2564,2690,5,"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!",16,1633
2565,2691,5,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.,9,753
2566,2692,5,"My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints.",16,1741
2567,2693,5,Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet,16,3282
2568,2694,4,"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids.",7,1518
2569,2695,5,Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.,4,2504
2570,2696,4,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk.",4,2607
2571,2697,5,purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software,7,1170
2572,2698,4,It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android,16,1133
2573,2699,4,It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.,7,891
2574,2700,4,"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books.",4,2191
2575,2701,4,Item work well and was easy to read from in day light,9,3526
2576,2702,3,Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it,7,1305
2577,2703,5,So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.,4,2657
2578,2704,4,"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue.",16,3662
2579,2705,4,No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.,7,2151
2580,2706,5,I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!,7,2982
2581,2707,4,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking,7,359
2582,2708,4,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.,7,1300
2583,2709,4,Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi,7,249
2584,2710,1,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor,4,3424
2585,2711,5,The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it.,4,2250
2586,2712,4,So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !,4,1557
2587,2713,5,Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it,16,2388
2588,2714,5,grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use,16,2188
2589,2715,5,Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case,16,2298
2590,2716,4,"I like this ereader. It is a little small, but you can increase the font.",9,2145
2591,2717,5,I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.,4,1489
2592,2718,5,We bought it for our granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!,16,3056
2593,2719,5,This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.,7,1433
2594,2720,4,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.,16,2916
2595,2721,5,I love this tablet for kids .. it's so much fun for them .. great buy ...,7,2331
2596,2722,5,Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet,4,299
2597,2723,5,I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.,4,398
2598,2724,5,This met my expectations and more. My granddaughter loves it. It's user friendly and has unlimited options for her. Would recommend to everyone!,7,3633
2599,2725,4,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far.",10,2927
2600,2726,3,"bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids",4,2682
2601,2727,5,Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable.,7,1201
2602,2728,5,"great product to use , easy to setup and use.. with all amazon options",4,2836
2603,2729,4,"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken.",16,2508
2604,2730,5,I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.,16,3812
2605,2731,5,It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.,4,2533
2606,2732,5,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!,4,3635
2607,2733,3,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",9,2340
2608,2734,5,I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..,4,1814
2609,2735,5,"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets.",4,3589
2610,2736,5,It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...,16,1703
2611,2737,5,"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them.",4,2420
2612,2738,4,We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,16,1009
2613,2739,5,It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!,16,1321
2614,2740,5,"I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work.",7,394
2615,2741,4,Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.,7,2585
2616,2742,5,"This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker.",4,549

2621,2747,4,Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around,9,3430
2622,2748,5,Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.,16,2735

2624,2750,5,"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!",4,1275
2625,2751,5,I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,6,313
2626,2752,5,"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance.",4,3205
2627,2753,5,Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.,16,728
2628,2754,5,Great price great product would recommend this gift,16,2860
2629,2755,5,Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.,4,815
2630,2756,4,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!",16,49
2631,2757,3,"Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage.",4,3257
2632,2758,5,"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks.",6,3707
2633,2759,4,got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.,4,2092
2634,2760,4,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.,16,32
2635,2761,5,Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.,16,2074
2636,2762,5,This has been awesome. For my. 5 year old nephew. Keeps him entertained and it works great.,16,3691
2637,2763,5,I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded,16,146
2638,2764,5,I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!,16,1972
2639,2765,3,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!,16,3727
2640,2766,5,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient,9,3511
2641,2768,5,Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price,16,3088
2642,2769,4,I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks,4,2334

2644,2771,5,Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!,16,1934
2645,2772,4,The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that,9,3549
2646,2773,4,Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.,7,247
2647,2774,5,This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.,4,2225
2648,2775,5,I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.,16,103
2649,2776,5,"Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case.",7,1606
2650,2777,5,"Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase.",16,281
2651,2778,5,My daughter loves this tablet. She drops it and it keeps going. she can't put it down.,16,3488
2652,2779,4,"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help",4,2892
2653,2780,4,"This tablet was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is technologically challenged and was able to set it up and use it with ease. Great multiuse tablet. The size is ok. Get the 8"" if you are like me and like a little more screamReal estate.",4,973
2654,2781,5,My 6 and 4 year old boys love it and so do the parents,16,195
2655,2782,4,This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.,16,1462
2656,2783,5,"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!",16,457
2657,2784,5,"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!",16,1410
2658,2785,5,"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.",7,1354
2659,2786,3,It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.,9,1040

2664,2791,4,"Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen.",7,2667
2665,2792,5,"Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.",16,2808
2666,2793,5,The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.,10,3159
2667,2794,4,"Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices.",4,1726
2668,2795,4,my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.,7,894

2670,2797,5,The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls,16,1869
2671,2798,4,This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.,4,3240
2672,2799,4,This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.,16,976
2673,2800,5,Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use,4,3695
2674,2801,5,"Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up",16,1456
2675,2802,4,Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it,16,2738
2676,2803,5,Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.,6,545
2677,2804,3,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it.",9,3022
2678,2805,4,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.",10,400
2679,2806,5,This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.,10,1931
2680,2807,5,"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use.",9,1734
2681,2808,5,"I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked.",7,896
2682,2809,5,My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.,7,559
2683,2810,4,"It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet",4,2354
2684,2811,5,"It is so easy to use it is super light, and makes a book to read with no effort at all!",9,3526
2685,2812,4,"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff.",16,1020
2686,2813,5,I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps,16,1718
2687,2814,5,"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups",7,35

2689,2816,5,"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink.",16,12
2690,2817,4,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen,7,2666
2691,2818,4,This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading,6,2753
2692,2819,5,Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere.,9,1298
2693,2820,5,"I've purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It's user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes.",16,665
2694,2821,5,Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.,4,1642
2695,2822,5,Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy,4,1154
2696,2823,4,I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.,16,1846
2697,2824,5,I'm enjoying the ease of having several reading options without the bulk.,9,1763
2698,2825,4,Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.,4,1097
2699,2826,4,I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.,7,340
2700,2827,5,"(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one.",4,2394
2701,2828,5,It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...,9,1990
2702,2829,5,"Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it",16,862
2703,2830,5,Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.,16,688

2771,2898,4,I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated.

2772,2899,4,These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.,7,3357
2773,2900,4,"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money.",16,377

I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all",7,1695
2776,2903,5,"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks",7,1570

2788,2915,5,Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend,9,2655
2789,2916,5,Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM,9,980
2790,2917,4,"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.",7,280

2798,2925,5,"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.",16,2427

2857,2984,5,works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet,16,3533
2858,2985,4,"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items.",16,3465
2859,2986,5,"Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc.",11,215
2860,2987,5,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.,11,415
2861,2988,5,Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.,11,2761
2862,2989,2,Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).,11,3778
2863,2990,5,Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound,11,2347
2864,2991,5,I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is,11,2374
2865,2992,5,"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.",11,2621
2866,2993,3,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.",11,1672
2867,2994,4,I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.,11,3777
2868,2995,5,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.",11,2198
2869,2996,4,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.,11,2758
2870,2997,5,Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!,11,1673
2871,2998,4,I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!,11,1976
2872,2999,5,These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!,11,152
2873,3000,5,Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books,11,3057
2874,3001,5,good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.,11,964
2875,3002,4,If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.,11,3694
2876,3003,5,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",11,513
2877,3004,4,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.,11,2283
2878,3005,5,Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.,11,1335
2879,3006,5,"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him",11,3376
2880,3007,5,"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.",11,3035
2881,3008,5,"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!",11,2002
2882,3009,5,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!,11,2469
2883,3010,5,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great.",11,2230
2884,3011,5,Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,11,280
2885,3012,4,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.,11,3134
2886,3013,5,We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.,11,3143
2887,3014,4,"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.",11,3409
2888,3015,4,"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",11,802
2889,3016,5,"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.",11,1400
2890,3017,5,Great product for when you are on the go.great sound,11,2437
2891,3018,5,"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!",11,141
2892,3019,1,"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79",11,762
2893,3020,5,This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.,11,2374
2894,3021,4,"I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though",11,3374
2895,3022,5,It's a great device to have. It does so many things. Very practical.,11,1815
2896,3023,4,"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice.",11,637
2897,3024,5,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands‚Ä¶you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit.",11,2668
2898,3025,5,"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.",11,481
2899,3026,3,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot.",11,1589
2900,3027,5,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-",11,2809
2901,3028,5,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?,11,2215
2902,3029,4,"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",11,2039
2903,3030,2,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.,11,3245
2904,3031,5,purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.,11,2459
2905,3032,5,"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.",11,1277
2906,3033,4,Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.,11,1629
2907,3034,4,"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options",11,1751
2908,3035,5,Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.,11,1556
2909,3036,5,This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.,11,1090
2910,3037,4,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.,11,175
2911,3038,5,The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it,11,65
2912,3039,5,The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.,11,2792
2913,3040,5,Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.,11,3357
2914,3041,3,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,11,2601
2915,3042,5,"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!",11,1726
2916,3043,5,"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.",11,1864
2917,3044,5,I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.,11,2801
2918,3045,5,Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!,11,3309
2919,3046,5,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",11,2806
2920,3047,5,Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun,11,3276
2921,3048,5,Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions,11,1253
2922,3049,5,"This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household.",11,1165
2923,3050,4,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.",11,1541
2924,3051,5,This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it,11,3623
2925,3052,5,"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.",11,936

2929,3056,5,Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.,11,1900
2930,3057,5,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate,11,280
2931,3058,5,"Wife loves it! Great sound, great technology! Compact and durable.",11,1416
2932,3059,5,This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button,11,3523
2933,3060,5,"I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase.",11,1894
2934,3061,4,"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!",11,3766
2935,3062,4,"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device.",11,2610
2936,3063,4,The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.,11,2899
2937,3064,1,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",11,2524
2938,3065,5,"Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use.",11,831
2939,3066,5,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,11,2412
2940,3067,5,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.,11,555
2941,3068,5,"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!",11,2728
2942,3069,5,"Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can.",11,2799
2943,3070,5,"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it.",11,2933
2944,3071,5,This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it,11,1151
2945,3072,5,Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.,11,779
2946,3073,5,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.",11,1063
2947,3074,5,This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.,11,1144
2948,3075,5,It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends,11,1486

2950,3077,5,"Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses",11,3541
2951,3078,5,"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.",11,2407
2952,3079,3,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",11,1827
2953,3080,3,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,11,2034
2954,3081,4,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack,11,560
2955,3082,4,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen.",11,3440
2956,3083,2,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",11,1119
2957,3084,5,"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!",11,1233
2958,3085,2,"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,11,84
2959,3086,5,Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.,11,1765
2960,3087,5,"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift.",11,2332
2961,3088,4,I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing,11,2235
2962,3089,5,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one.",11,165

You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",11,2587

2968,3095,4,"excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again",11,2192
2969,3096,5,"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price",11,2974
2970,3097,3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,11,3479
2971,3098,5,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too.",11,2678

2983,3110,4,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.",11,54
2984,3111,5,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",11,1800
2985,3112,5,"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot.",11,807
2986,3113,5,"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!",11,3631
2987,3114,3,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,11,380
2988,3115,3,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.,11,2693
2989,3116,5,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.,11,2802
2990,3117,5,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,11,2531
2991,3118,4,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap,11,2548
2992,3119,3,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa",11,1916
2993,3120,5,I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.,11,2670
2994,3121,5,Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal,11,3646
2995,3122,5,You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.,11,1082
2996,3123,5,"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable.",11,2891
2997,3124,5,This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!,11,1976
2998,3125,5,"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc.",11,2679
2999,3126,5,Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.,11,2400
3000,3127,5,"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.",11,3483
3001,3128,5,"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!",11,270
3002,3129,4,"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it.",11,2559
3003,3130,5,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR",11,3468
3004,3131,5,"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!",11,3287
3005,3132,4,"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget.",11,2721
3006,3133,5,Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!,11,3281
3007,3134,4,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.,11,2306
3008,3135,5,"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office.",11,1427
3009,3136,5,"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.",11,293
3010,3137,5,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,11,3045
3011,3138,5,"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!",11,1343
3012,3139,5,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.,11,2611
3013,3140,5,"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want.",11,2887
3014,3141,4,"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming",11,1608
3015,3142,5,"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.",11,546
3016,3143,5,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.,11,3290
3017,3144,2,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype.",11,255
3018,3145,4,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.",11,1050
3019,3146,4,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,11,2197
3020,3147,4,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,11,78
3021,3148,3,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,11,2506
3022,3149,4,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.",11,2374
3023,3150,5,Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.,11,3704
3024,3151,4,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.,11,1651
3025,3152,5,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously.",11,2959
3026,3153,5,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.,11,128
3027,3154,2,"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",11,522
3028,3155,2,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,11,2794
3029,3156,5,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.,11,3275
3030,3157,4,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.",11,3590
3031,3158,5,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy,11,1391
3032,3159,4,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.",11,3402
3033,3160,5,"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...",11,1791
3034,3161,5,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.",11,816
3035,3162,4,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.",11,226
3036,3163,5,Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!,11,95
3037,3164,1,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,11,1072
3038,3165,4,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.,11,3327
3039,3166,5,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.,11,1550
3040,3167,5,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.,11,2281
3041,3168,5,Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!,11,3320
3042,3169,5,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked,11,688
3043,3170,3,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",11,1134
3044,3171,5,"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.",11,2363
3045,3172,5,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!",11,2348
3046,3173,4,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",11,836
3047,3174,4,"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.",11,705
3048,3175,5,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.,11,3217
3049,3176,5,"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.",11,1450
3050,3177,4,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats",11,3463
3051,3178,5,It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station,11,3329
3052,3179,5,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.,11,3231
3053,3180,5,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music,11,3748
3054,3181,4,"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist.....",11,709
3055,3182,5,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.",11,653
3056,3183,4,Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.,11,1353
3057,3184,4,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement.",11,695
3058,3185,5,Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price,11,1283
3059,3186,5,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",11,187
3060,3187,4,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....,11,2509
3061,3188,5,I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.,11,1647
3062,3189,5,"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.",11,2528
3063,3190,4,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.,11,1624
3064,3191,5,"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!",11,3355
3065,3192,5,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge.",11,1461
3066,3193,4,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.",11,1038
3067,3194,4,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.,11,1135
3068,3195,5,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",11,28
3069,3196,5,Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.,11,2953
3070,3197,5,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",11,2572
3071,3198,5,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!,11,620
3072,3199,5,i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.,11,1756
3073,3200,5,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,11,3696
3074,3201,3,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",11,2577
3075,3202,4,Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa,11,2159
3076,3203,5,My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,11,3172
3077,3204,5,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.,11,610
3078,3205,4,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift,11,2045
3079,3206,5,"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.",11,628
3080,3207,5,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking.",11,947
3081,3208,5,Great tech works well highly recommended no issues,11,1968
3082,3209,5,Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.,11,3060
3083,3210,4,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.",11,1524
3084,3211,5,I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.,8,3252
3085,3212,5,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",8,646

3089,3217,5,Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites,8,780
3090,3218,5,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",17,1982

After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)",17,2893
3097,3227,4,"I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7.",8,2719
3098,3228,5,Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!,8,2832

3114,3248,5,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase.",8,1759
3115,3249,5,"I had reviewed and looked at this Samsung 65"" 4k HDTV and at this timeit was the best for the money..Very satisfied with TV and would recommend it to anyone.",8,1078

3133,3267,4,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read.

3136,3271,4,"I have been a kindle owner since they first came out. This version has many,many more bells and whistles but I still use mine mostly for books, audible books and a place for me to download music I can listen to when I travel.

3141,3276,5,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .",8,646
3142,3277,1,"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",8,296
3143,3278,5,"An amazing electronic tool, so portable, great storage, books, great convenience.",8,2435
3144,3279,5,I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.,8,1848

3147,3283,5,"I find the picture quality amazing, the size over earlier model is welcome. Also, battery lasts many hours. For the price, it is a real bargain.",8,3747
3148,3285,5,My sister told me about the Kindle Fire and I wanted one so she said she bought hers from Best Buy.,8,474
3149,3286,5,Sales guy didn't have much knowledge about the Kindle. He wasn't very helpful in getting me started.,8,2262
3150,3287,5,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",17,621
3151,3288,5,Want a port for addition memory this model had it!,8,2565
3152,3289,5,"This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability",8,3393
3153,3290,3,For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak,8,2813
3154,3291,5,I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book,17,2330
3155,3292,4,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.",17,2284
3156,3293,5,"This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa.",8,3692
3157,3294,5,Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase,8,3685

3160,3297,4,I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars,8,316
3161,3298,5,"very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price",8,2607

3165,3302,5,Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.,8,1953
3166,3303,5,"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!",17,59
3167,3304,5,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.",17,674
3168,3305,5,"Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising.",8,2998
3169,3306,5,Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers,17,2466
3170,3307,4,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",17,3727
3171,3308,5,Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.,17,2779
3172,3309,5,I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic.,8,2350
3173,3310,4,This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.,8,346
3174,3311,5,"I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.",8,3764
3175,3312,3,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.",8,3803
3176,3313,5,"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.",17,3574
3177,3314,5,"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.",17,1111
3178,3315,5,"Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping",8,1007
3179,3316,4,Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps. Go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore. Made my Fire into regular android tablet. Much happier now.,8,2152
3180,3317,4,My wife really enjoys the amazon fire. Has very good picture quality. Very easy to figure out how to use because its similar to our smart phone.,8,2883
3181,3318,5,"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.",17,1212
3182,3319,5,"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.",8,880
3183,3320,5,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",17,3814
3184,3321,5,"The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser, and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet.",8,3814

3188,3325,5,makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.,8,1909
3189,3326,4,I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!,8,470

3196,3333,5,Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn't really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV.,8,761
3197,3334,5,Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.,8,625
3198,3335,5,I would be happy to give it as Christmas gifts to many of the people I know. I love the size of the screen. A charge last and the Bluetooth sinks well with the wireless keyboard. It's almost as good as I IPad.,8,2345

Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.",21,2456
3205,3342,5,"so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one....",21,2216
3206,3343,4,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.",21,1352
3207,3344,4,"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.",21,1337

3209,3346,5,"I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version",21,3507
3210,3347,4,"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this.",21,283
3211,3348,3,Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.,21,2181
3212,3349,5,"I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit.",21,284
3213,3350,3,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.",21,1940
3214,3351,5,"Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions.",21,3441
3215,3352,4,The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.,21,2817
3216,3353,5,This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.,21,2514
3217,3354,5,This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.,21,647
3218,3355,5,"Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!",21,3211
3219,3356,5,Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.,21,2566
3220,3357,4,"Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!",21,1862
3221,3358,5,"Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space",21,2649
3222,3359,5,The best kindle that I ever had!It is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.Great for indoor and outdoor reading,21,1192
3223,3360,5,I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact.,21,45
3224,3361,5,"This is my third Kindle and the best one yet. Love the new controls, the backlit page, the compact size and the ease of use. I would recommend the Kindle Voyage to all readers!",21,677
3225,3362,5,The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage.,21,1077
3226,3363,5,I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.,21,3082
3227,3364,4,Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.,21,2432
3228,3365,5,"It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level.",21,2870
3229,3366,5,"I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.",21,280
3230,3367,5,bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it,21,681
3231,3368,5,"Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience.",21,1467
3232,3369,4,I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.,21,1259
3233,3370,5,"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc.",21,2356
3234,3371,4,"I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining.",21,3349
3235,3372,5,"Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun...",21,202
3236,3373,4,Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.,21,2079
3237,3374,4,"Really like the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my Ipad!.",21,2969
3238,3375,5,Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.,21,2983
3239,3376,5,"One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)",21,426
3240,3377,5,What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.,21,2656
3241,3378,5,"excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost",21,874
3242,3379,5,Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.,21,865
3243,3380,5,"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.",21,216
3244,3381,5,Love this kindle - the press side page turner is great.,21,1880
3245,3382,5,Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly,21,186
3246,3383,5,"The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!",21,2879
3247,3384,4,"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks.",21,2867
3248,3385,5,"I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly.",21,3205
3249,3386,5,The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.,21,3620
3250,3387,5,"Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed.",21,21
3251,3388,4,"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.",21,260
3252,3389,5,I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.,21,2995
3253,3390,5,We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.,21,287
3254,3391,5,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.,21,1579
3255,3392,5,"I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page.",21,1045
3256,3393,5,Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight.,21,1400
3257,3394,5,Purchased after theft in Seattle. It was on sale and works great.,21,1294
3258,3395,5,"I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie.",21,2786
3259,3396,5,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",21,2032
3260,3397,5,New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.,21,317
3261,3398,5,why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!,21,239
3262,3399,5,I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.,21,2019
3263,3400,5,I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.,21,2620
3264,3401,4,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",21,443
3265,3402,5,Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it.,21,776
3266,3403,4,"I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own.",21,630
3267,3404,3,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,21,2954
3268,3405,4,Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn't justify the added cost. So far I'm happy with this model.,21,1417
3269,3406,5,This is my third one of these and this is the best one by far.,21,2153
3270,3407,5,"This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.",21,1945
3271,3408,5,"This readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag. Easy to use, controls for children are very effective. Am glad I bought it.",21,1083
3272,3409,3,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.,21,378
3273,3410,5,"My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes.",21,2847
3274,3411,5,"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.",21,1757
3275,3412,4,Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small,21,226
3276,3413,5,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.,21,1056
3277,3414,4,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.",21,2149
3278,3415,5,Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.,21,2158
3279,3416,5,Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would.,21,2477
3280,3417,5,I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design.,21,2893
3281,3418,5,"It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks.",21,2473
3282,3419,1,"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",21,1716
3283,3420,5,I had been reading books on my iPad for years and finally broke down to get a kindle. It's exactly what I hoped. The screen is easy to read in any light. It's a light weight and size and easy to stow away in a small bag.,21,2236
3284,3421,5,This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.,21,1681
3285,3422,5,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.",21,3628
3286,3423,4,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.",5,3310
3287,3424,5,outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2,5,2760
3288,3425,5,This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.,5,474
3289,3426,4,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.",5,3683
3290,3427,5,I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!,5,1451
3291,3428,5,"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!",5,2496
3292,3429,1,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",5,3761
3293,3430,5,I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well,5,1116
3294,3431,4,"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads.",5,1771

3301,3438,5,Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.,5,2854

3305,3442,5,Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend,5,2858
3306,3443,4,Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder,5,1477
3307,3444,5,I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .,5,1663
3308,3445,5,"I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!",5,559
3309,3446,1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.,5,1992
3310,3447,5,"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely.",5,2502
3311,3448,4,"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.",5,2965
3312,3449,5,Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.,5,3779

3329,3466,5,Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly!,5,1674
3330,3467,4,"The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books.",5,1981
3331,3468,4,Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure,5,2549
3332,3469,4,"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts.",5,2622
3333,3470,5,We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.,5,561
3334,3471,4,"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.",5,1681

3343,3480,5,"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies"".",5,2189

There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money",5,226
3349,3486,5,"I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration.",5,970
3350,3487,4,This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.,5,860
3351,3488,4,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.",5,2843
3352,3489,5,"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading",5,854

3358,3495,3,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.",5,1433
3359,3496,4,"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent.

I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately.

3409,3546,5,"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",5,1062

3427,3564,3,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.",5,3058

3429,3566,4,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.",5,3066

I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch.

3557,3694,4,"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!",5,564
3558,3695,4,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs",5,295
3559,3696,5,"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life.",5,2562
3560,3697,5,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.,5,2609
3561,3698,3,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,5,1115

3569,3706,5,"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.",5,185
3570,3707,5,This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.,5,226
3571,3708,5,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.,5,734
3572,3709,5,This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.,5,3394
3573,3710,5,Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.,5,2914

3579,3716,5,"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.",5,1238
3580,3717,4,So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.,5,2411

3591,3728,5,Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.,5,2214
3592,3729,5,"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",5,3033
3593,3730,5,Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.,5,3407
3594,3731,5,We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.,5,3562
3595,3732,4,"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps",5,110
3596,3733,3,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,5,2330
3597,3734,5,Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....,5,2146
3598,3735,5,This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.,5,43

3604,3741,5,This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality,5,1548

3606,3743,5,The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.,5,1584
3607,3744,5,My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted.,5,1670
3608,3745,5,"I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase.",5,721

3614,3751,2,"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics.",5,1610

I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.,5,3168

I returned this item pronto!",5,869

Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)",5,51

3682,3819,2,This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.,5,2415

She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games.",5,271
3691,3828,4,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.",5,2732

3702,3839,5,I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me.

3704,3841,5,"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift.",5,1501
3705,3842,4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,5,760

3710,3847,4,I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.,5,56
3711,3848,5,Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay.,5,3713

3714,3851,5,"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle.

3720,3857,5,Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.,5,122
3721,3858,4,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",5,447
3722,3859,5,Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.,5,38

3731,3868,4,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet.

There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption.",5,240
3734,3871,4,For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.,5,3146
3735,3873,5,"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement.

She loves it!",5,1631
3736,3874,5,"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough.

3754,3892,5,"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it.

3791,3929,5,"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!",5,1080

3795,3933,4,"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement.",5,609

3801,3939,4,"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet.",5,2322

3828,3966,5,My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.,5,3341

3843,3981,5,"This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook",5,2810
3844,3982,4,I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.,5,3084

3851,3989,5,"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there.

3879,4017,4,"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon.",5,1252
3880,4018,5,A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.,5,3654
3881,4019,5,I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.,5,376
3882,4020,5,I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use,5,130
3883,4021,5,I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift.,5,1291
3884,4022,4,"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it",5,3243

3891,4029,5,Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.,5,1746
3892,4030,4,I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.,5,2623
3893,4031,4,I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.,5,3742
3894,4032,4,"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen.",5,2434

3898,4036,4,This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.,5,2812
3899,4037,5,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!",5,1326
3900,4038,5,"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home.

3902,4040,5,I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.,5,392

Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer.",5,2326
3905,4043,4,Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!,5,1079

3914,4052,5,I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!,5,2251
3915,4053,5,"This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's ""awesome"", which is high praise indeed.",5,1849
3916,4054,4,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",5,2440

3929,4067,5,It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.,5,2827
3930,4068,5,"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome.",5,3221
3931,4069,5,Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price,5,943
3932,4070,4,Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.,5,2439
3933,4071,5,"Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go!",5,1424
3934,4072,5,make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.,5,1893

3936,4074,5,Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.,5,2496
3937,4075,3,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",5,1618
3938,4076,5,I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!!,5,1433
3939,4077,5,"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids.",5,2103

3941,4079,5,One of the best tablets on the market for its value,5,3273
3942,4080,4,"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.",5,1191
3943,4081,5,My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price.,5,2606
3944,4082,5,This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price.,5,1002
3945,4083,5,"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far.",5,3545

3948,4086,4,"Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7"". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven't seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast.",5,58
3949,4087,4,Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse,5,3326

3958,4096,4,Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.,5,3144
3959,4097,5,"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!",5,1433
3960,4098,5,"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet",5,2117
3961,4099,5,I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ‚Äãis a very functional and easy to use.,5,3526
3962,4100,5,"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses.",5,4
3963,4101,5,The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone,5,444
3964,4102,5,"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books....",5,3041

3967,4105,5,"I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned.",5,1515
3968,4106,5,"Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price.",5,7

3970,4108,4,Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.,5,3803
3971,4109,5,This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.,5,2813
3972,4110,4,"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.",5,3645
3973,4111,4,Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books.,5,474
3974,4112,3,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.",5,427

3979,4117,4,"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price.",5,1465
3980,4118,5,I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.,5,574

3992,4130,5,Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school,5,227
3993,4131,3,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it.

3997,4135,5,"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips.",5,298
3998,4136,4,Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.,5,2692

4118,4268,3,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.",1,3497

4138,4291,5,Gave as a gift to niece in hospital she loved it. Was able to do everything on the tablet she wanted to. Easy to use I was the one who set it up for her was very simple.,1,2249
4139,4292,3,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better,1,2077
4140,4293,4,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.,1,1983

4149,4305,5,So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.,1,244
4150,4306,4,Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.,1,571

4160,4316,5,It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time,1,2037

My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her.",1,144

4177,4339,4,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere.",1,405

Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.",1,1399

4457,4644,4,"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD.",1,3752

4492,4679,5,"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all",1,1959

4497,4684,5,"Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there.

4500,4687,5,i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd,12,3241
4501,4688,5,This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner.

4504,4691,5,"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train.",12,908
4505,4692,4,"This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.",12,114
4506,4693,4,"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light",12,876

4511,4699,5,The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!,12,2873
4512,4700,5,"I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool",12,2889
4513,4701,4,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it.",12,3428
4514,4702,5,As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.,12,2819

4516,4704,5,"I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi.",12,2133

Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows.

4557,4745,5,Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.,22,3559
4558,4746,5,Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year,22,1924
4559,4747,5,Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.,22,2142
4560,4748,4,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed.

I got the blue!",22,2537

Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",22,1482
4565,4753,4,This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.,22,1899
4566,4754,5,Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.,22,1382

I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things.",22,1124
4569,4757,4,Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.,22,1797

4572,4760,5,this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me,22,2267
4573,4761,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",22,1443
4574,4763,5,BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.,18,2040
4575,4765,5,This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.,18,2375
4576,4766,5,"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.",18,1373
4577,4767,5,The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case,18,2330
4578,4768,5,Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking,18,2115
4579,4769,5,"This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small.",18,2111
4580,4770,5,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though",18,621
4581,4771,5,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",18,3814
4582,4772,5,"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!",18,1905
4583,4773,5,Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.,18,1887
4584,4774,4,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.,18,383
4585,4775,5,Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.,18,79
4586,4777,5,"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",18,2722
4587,4779,4,I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.,18,746
4588,4781,5,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",18,1982
4589,4782,5,"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",18,429
4590,4783,5,"It fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight, especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that's a minor thing.",18,3447
4591,4785,5,"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go.",18,920

4594,4789,5,"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all.",18,2817

I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point.",18,662
4598,4793,5,"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",18,3814
4599,4794,5,This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact.

Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",13,1482

Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows.

4643,4838,5,"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things.",13,1124
4644,4839,4,I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.,13,2635

4646,4841,4,Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it,13,2643
4647,4842,3,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure.",13,3586
4648,4843,5,This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.,13,3075
4649,4844,5,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.",15,9
4650,4845,4,Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.,15,1142

4652,4847,5,Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.,13,1382

4657,4852,4,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.",13,327
4658,4853,5,The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.,13,2607
4659,4854,5,I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!,13,2830

They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!",13,2537
4663,4858,5,i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read,13,77

4665,4860,5,"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle.",15,1496

4670,4865,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",13,1443
4671,4866,5,Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!,15,805
4672,4867,4,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.",15,305
4673,4868,5,I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.,15,884
4674,4869,5,I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,13,313
4675,4870,5,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",15,3799
4676,4871,4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",15,2155
4677,4872,4,"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",15,623

4724,4919,5,Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.,14,2817

4741,4936,5,Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.,14,1768
