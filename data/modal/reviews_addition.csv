5000,4,The TV is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs. You have to register it using a code. I tried doing so with my phone but it didn't work. So I called a number on the registering app - Turns out I must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number. This guy told me I needed to pay $99 to register the TV. I said not a chance bozo I'll read the manual and send it back If I have to pay anything else with the TV. I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.,24,401,pos
5001,1,"This TV had no picture. I think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it. Yes, I am sure that's it. I think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before I opened it, but I can't talk about that, per Amazon's rules. Yet, having an adequate cushion is very important. Very disappointed. I love my other Roku TVs from TCL but this one was doomed. TCL should rework this feature.",24,402,neg
5002,4,"I got 3 of these 40"" TV's for the bedrooms at $199 plus tax and I am very pleased with them. Great picture, easy set up and an over all great value. They do have Roku built in so you do have to go thru some steps at Roku.com/link to set up your Roku account. If you already have an account it's even easier. There was no problem connecting to my WIFI and navigating with the remote is pretty simple.",24,403,pos
5003,5," was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room. I got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room. :) 32 is pictured!",24,404,pos
5004,1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV ITS NOT WORTH IT. It doesn't connect to WiFi and if it does Everytime it is turned on you'll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect. Now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all. When you call the makers of the TV on their support line their 1 and only solution was to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Awful customer service. Awful product. Awful everything. Don't waste your money buy from a better brand. Even at 200$ it's not worth it because for them to call it a smart TV is false. I'm sending it back in getting my money back.,24,405,neg
5005,5,"A nightmare to active TV . As soon as I went to the website to activate tv my phone blew up with people saying I can help you active , but you must create an account first. So I did and could not complete activation until I provided my credit card. Needless to say I did not provide that and 2 hours later finally tv was activated. Obvious i was being scammed because it does not cost anything to activate. Beware of scammers from Roku!",24,406,pos
5006,3,"The tv is only about 35 inches, not 40",24,407,neu
5007,3,I liked this at first but now it‚Äôs requiring an update and will not update. It‚Äôs stuck in a verification loop and now all I can watch is antenna tv. If I wanted I wouldn‚Äôt have bought a smart tv.,24,408,neu
5008,3,"The remote on this model feels cheaper than the 52"" model (which we have in the living room). There's a noticeable difference in the quality. If you're looking for a cheap TV I recommend this one but if you pay for the next model up you'll get what you pay for with the higher quality peripheral.",24,409,pos
5009,2,"Very reasonable value, but I can't get the remote to communicate with the tv. There is a clear piece of plastic on the bottom of the tv in the center. Is that supposed to be removed? Customer support is not available on the weekend",24,410,pos
5010,5,"We love this TV ... We bought the 24 inch TV and linked to to an Alexa device for the Kitchen as it fits under the cabinet. I linked it to our Echo Alexa device and it works great! For kitchen use, 720p is perfectly adequate, and it looks fantastic. I am thinking about getting a keyboard and mouse for it in order to make it easier to find recipes,",25,411,pos
5011,1,"Beyond disappointing. Purchased this TV solely to have linked to my echo for the hands free voice control. It works for about 30 minutes, and then will proceed to tell me it ""doesnt support that"". I've run the gamut of factory reset, un plug, un link etc. Nothing works and Amazon customer service has no fix for me. I feel like I wasted my money, so to you I say save your money and buy a better quality smart TV for the same price. I will change this review if they ever fix this and decide to help me",25,412,neg

5014,4,"So wanted just a cute little tv for my room and this size is perfect, love the remote I can do Alexa or just go straight to Netflix. Has options for cable and hdmi I really only use it for Netflix,Spotify, and hbo. Only downfall is that sometimes on Hulu or hbo it will lose sound or just randomly go back to the home screen which is a tad annoying but besides that sounds good and picture is amazing!! Worth it for me!!",25,415,pos
5015,4,"I didn't even turn the TV on. Once I unpacked it I realized it had holes for a 100x200 VESA mount. However my wall mount doesn't support that. Given that my wall mount is more expensive than the TV, I'm returning the TV. My mistake, I should have checked first.",25,416,neg
5016,4,So far so good. I bought this from my son to be used a video game tv for his bedroom. So far no complaints from him. Setting it up was a chore. We are cord cutters so there isn‚Äôt any cable boxes to hook up but I did have a lot of apps to sign into to. That took some time üòÅ It took me sometime to figure out how to get to the actual App Store and not just featured apps and some of the games are very expensive for an app. $15 for final fantasy. Most games average $3 or $5. The picture quality and sound are fine for a bedroom tv. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a main room tv unless you plan on using a sound bar. I have his TV set at 30 for volume and it‚Äôs not too loud. I only paid $100 for this tv and to me that was a heck of a bargain. He is happy and that makes me happy üòäI paid $4 I believe for a 4 year warranty so this tv should last awhile.,25,417,pos
5017,3,I give it 3 stars because I didn't like how it was exposed at my front door it wasn't covered so everybody knew it was a TV I also didn't like the smell It still smells like battery I had to open my doors and windows because it was so strong but other than that I really like it.,25,418,neu
5018,3,"Love the TV!! However, not happy with the amazon fire! Was not compatible with our WiFi. We were fed up after nothing would load, so I purchased Roku ultra! Wow!! What a difference! Now we‚Äôre happy!! I have given a 3 star only bc of having to spend additional money for the Roku. Otherwise, the TV is a 5 star!!",25,419,pos

5029,1,I would not recommend it due to issues among many things,26,430,neg
5030,3,"I'm sure the product itself is great. It had a wonderful picture and the sound was okay, not excellent. I have a nice sound bar that's more than made up for it. I bought factory refurbished. The TV would just shut off every now and again. Sometimes after it shut off the only way to get it to turn back on was to unplug it from the electricity, hold the power button for 5 seconds, plug it back into the electricity and then turn it back on. I know that trick because of an issue I had with a previous television. I ended up sending it back and not getting another one. I put my Vizio D32f-F1 back up on the mount. The picture quality is not quite the same but it's a bedroom TV. Again, I'm sure the product itself is great but even though I'm a firm believer in certified refurbished to help save the planet I just didn't want to go there again for this particular item.",27,431,neu

5042,4,"My only complaint is the sound quality. Play with the settings and it sounds better but still lacking. The picture is good, but there is some white around the edges of the screen on a blank screen. Once the move starts they are not noticeable anymore. Overall $500 is a good deal so far!",29,443,neu
5043,5,I have been with echo from the beginning and I was disappointed when I opened up my new spot. Of which i had purchased 4 of them and I had specifically wanted them for sound quality as well as the screen and the speakers are on the lower side not the bottom. BUT... when you put this very well built and weighted magnetic connector to the bottom all of a sudden the sound bounces off of this perfectly round circle and spreads out through the Room to sound in for Beautiful so it's kind of like buying a Mustang and not taking it out of 1st a gear unless you buy this piece. You are limiting the sound quality of a beautiful beautiful machine. In short order one Today.,30,1,pos
5044,5,"I was really annoyed I had to spend another $20 on this stand, but I really love it. The ability to position my Spot is helpful. The stand has a nice weight to it and has the same non-slip material that is on the bottom of the Spot. I was very pleased that it magnets so the connection feels very secure. Think the sound is better when on the stand as well. In the end it‚Äôs worth the extra $20!",30,2,pos
5045,4,"Made well, makes spot sound better but should be $10.00 max. Amazon is starting to get greedy!",30,3,neu
5046,3,"It's perfect for my Echo Spot, but the only reason why I gave it a 3-star is because of the price, I believe $20 is too expensive. It should have been included with the Echo Spot for free.",30,4,pos
5047,3,"For some reason I thought I could move it left an right...nope. It only moves up and down. Not much else out there so I guess I'll keep it. Magnetic connection to base. So, don't be too hard moving it around.",30,5,pos

5053,5,"The new Bose Home 500 offers the best sound I have heard in small speaker and Alexa is a fine addition. My Bose is next to an Apple Home and I like the Bose sound much better. The Bose also displays album covers and other information. I easily activated Tune-in Radio, Spotify and Amazon music APPS.",31,35,pos

5055,2,"It sounds great but you can‚Äôt says Alexa play whatever from Spotify. You have to use the bose app to play from Spotify. Dealbreaker for me, since I want voice control",31,37,neu
5056,1,"This speaker looks great, and sounds great, when it works. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt work as advertised. It connects to Bluetooth just fine. But so do all Bose wireless speakers. The real selling point of this speaker was it‚Äôs seamless connection to multiple music services. That capability is a disaster. My Bose Speaker 500 was extremely difficult to connect to WiFi. Just setting up the speaker was extremely frustrating. It required multiple attempts to connect to the Bose Music app, and I mean I tried dozens of times. The app is horrible, the connection to the device is horrible. And I haven‚Äôt even started to discuss how awful the music service playback works. It absolutely refuses to play SiriusXM. Nothing I do works. That was a primary reason I purchased this device, and at this point I‚Äôve given up trying to connect to Sirius. It won‚Äôt even play music from my Amazon Prime account, that should work easily through Alexa. No such luck for me. Other elements of Alexa work ok. It will tell me what the temperature is outside, so I‚Äôve got that going for me. Of course, that‚Äôs not why I spent $400. It‚Äôs a complete waste of money. Do not waste your money on this awful product.",31,38,neg
5057,5,"Bose sound keeps getting better. This was a replacement for an original Sound Dock which finally died. I actually paid for this, unlike some other reviews here. I suspect their value judgments are a Little off. Something for nothing makes it too easy to quibble. Set up was easy as could be. Found my google mesh network right away, updated itself and connected to amazon music, an 8 year old iPod, an iPhone 8, an iPad Air, a surface pro 4 and an iPhone 6 with no issues at all. The sound quality‚Äôs amazing. I am an audiophile, and was quite impressed. No substitute for way too much gear, but great for outside the listening room. The app worked perfectly. The engineering was as expected from the company Amar Bose built. Kudos",31,39,pos
5058,3,"There is a lot to like about this speaker. The sound is great and the design is very attractive. Unfortunately, there are enough pieces that work as well as an Echo speaker. Asking it play to music, it often told me it wasn't authorized until a second attempt leading to an interesting argument. I returned this and bought an extra Echo and the Echo Sub instead. This setup improved sound quality in my opinion. Also everything works better with the straight Echo setup.",31,40,pos
5059,3,"This is a BOSE sound quality speaker. I‚Äôve been using it in a large family room and it is quite capable of filling the entire room with sound as promised. The issues I‚Äôve had with this device are related with the interface between de app and the speaker and the speaker and the router. So far in about a month I‚Äôve had to reboot the speaker 4 times because the ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù functions stopped working or the WI-FI suddenly became disabled and wouldn‚Äôt reconnect. I hope that with further updates to the software this issues become resolved, but as this date I would choose another speaker if I was counting on using the AIexa functions of this device.",31,41,pos
5060,1,"I received the order and the product would not work via blue tooth. For example, I would play a song on Spotify, YouTube, Amazon Prime Music, it would play through the speaker, however after 30 seconds to a minute, the music started skipping. To remedy this, I took it to my parent's house (different wifi / diff location), and the same thing. The specific item I received skipped 100% of the time I tried to use it.",31,42,neu
5061,1,Received 2 echo dots - 3rd generation. I thought I needed help setting them up. Contacted Alexa support. I was told that the computer I was using was infected and that I would have to purchase a $149.00 firewall before he could activate the 2 dots. He wouldn't discuss putting another tech on the line. I hung up and figured out what I was doing wrong and got both the units to work properly. Either the tech did not know what he was doing or he was trying to con me. I do like the product so far. Maybe my rating should be 4 stars for product and one star for support,33,43,pos
5062,1," When playing music, sometimes the sound seems distorted specially the highs (trebles). If it happens i have to tell alexa to change music. But after several minutes it will be distorted again. I just got it yesterday, I will observe it if it still does that I may have to return it. I‚Äôm very disappointed.",33,44,neg
5063,5,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall. My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night. If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome. I'm really loving it. The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead. I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home. I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc. The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more? Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!",33,70,pos
5064,5,"As always, Amazon echo dots are perfect. One thing, the Alexa app still sucks and is very user unfriendly. Amazon - can you fix your app and make the GUI more user friendly? Quit the confusing setup process on your APP?",33,71,neg
5065,5,"So we have 4 of the second generation dots and was excited to see the new one. Set up was super fast, sound and looks great!

5067,5,I finally found a woman (Alexa) that listens and can be controlled. (Just kidding) Excellent product. This device saves a lot of time by automating my household items and by adding information and music to areas I spend a lot of time in. Eliminates the need from carrying a radio from room to room.,33,74,pos

5078,5,"I love portable bluetooth speakers, but I also have five children. So, I tend to go through a lot of portable electronics (among other things). I bought this speaker after watching an in-store demonstration where an employee started playing music before proceeding to launch the speaker across the store like a football several times before finally submerging the speaker in a tank of water. The speaker never missed a beat. My personal experience has been the same. My toddlers are constantly knocking my speaker off of shelves and have given it several well intentioned baths. Aside fron a few small scratches, the speaker is as good as new. The quality of the soeakwr is also great for its size. Music is clear and crisp and the speaker gets loud. The speaker also sounds the same no matter what direction you turn it. My only complaint is the bass is not as deep as other speakers, namely JBLs. However, the durabiliry of this speaker more than compensates for the bass.",35,201,pos

My 4 year old daughter has dropped it quite a few times and it still works flawlessly. The connecting/disconnecting alert isn't annoying or loud. The battery last quite a long time, i only have to charge it maybe once a week. When you plug in the charger it has a nice pulsing LED that tells you it's charging.",35,203,pos

Setup is easy through iOS (iPhone 7 Plus), and using their UEBoom app to update the firmware was a plus. I use this as my bathroom speaker, mostly. But it's enough to fill the house if we should need to. This is my favorite Bluetooth speaker so far, and I used to work at a large fruit company as a supervisor in their stores. I've heard a lot of speakers and these are some of the best.",35,204,pos
5082,5,"This is my second one. To my ears (that's important as SQ is totally subjective) these speakers sound more natural, go deeper in a balanced, tighter manner, have surprisingly clear mids and ok, thought clipped, highs. The first one I bought was lucky as I put zero thought into it. This one I researched and compared it to the UE Megaboom, JBL Charge 3, JBL Xtreme, Bose Revolve+ and Bose Soundlink III. Both my partner and I preferred the Boom 2 in every audible criteria we had. Its not an audiophile speaker by any stretch of the imagination. But its not annoying and to those of us with decent sound systems, cheap speakers can be tests in listening endurance.",35,205,pos
5083,5,"Great speaker with enough oomph to fill a medium sized room. The app works great and even allows you to turn the speaker on/off through your phone. I picked up a second one to make use of the party mode which allows you to either sync up both speakers for true stereo seperation. Build quality is rock solid and I have no worries about bringing the Boom 2 anywhere. UE's newest version, the Blast has some updated bells and whistles, but this older iteration still sounds great and offers awesome value now that the price has dropped.",35,206,pos

5093,5,Love this charger! Its lightweight anf compact. I can easily carry it in my bag. Plus it has 4 ports! I can charge so many devices at the same time and they all charge fast. I haven't noted any delays in charging or slow charging. 2.4 ans 2.1 A port so you can pick n choose. I charge my watch n phone with this! Plus when Im travelling abroad i take it with me so I dont need to buy a whole new charger! Worked fine in Asia and Europe!,37,702,pos
5094,5,"This compact multi-county adapter is just as advertised. it is relatively small in size and comes in a zippered case (handy)--easy to toss into my travel bag (during or between trips). In addition, the locking mechanism is perfect...something you don't realize you need until you try to use an adapter without one!! it works just as described, and i will buy a second one for a friend. (PS....it DOESN'T include a converter for India, so if that is on your itinerary...you will need a separate plug.)",37,703,pos
5095,5,"I bought this for one of my children traveling to Europe to work there for a year. It is absolute perfect, it has everything in one place for all the places in Europe. She can travel and not worry about using her laptop or charging her phone, etc. For anybody traveling a lot, this is the adapter to get, the one that does it all. ",37,704,pos
5096,5,I like the fact that it comes in a small size and is easy to pack. I am waiting to use it overseas on our next trip. I think it is nice that it is all purpose because it has three different settings and can be used in many countries. I bought it because the last time we went overseas we needed to have an adapter to use any electronic device such as hair dryer or a shaver to make them work. Different countries have different voltages that they use for their electric appliances and our daily appliances will not work without an adapter.,37,705,pos
5097,5,"I just received the Power Plug adapter in Dec 2018... I purchased for an upcoming trip to Italy. While I haven't yet used it outside the USA, I can tell you that it's very easy to use, completely matches the description from the seller in it's ability to work in Europe, Australia, USA, etc. It's construction is solid and I tested it on my home outlet (of course in USA) and it worked great. My trip to Italy is in June 2019, following that trip, I'll provide an update to this review.",37,706,pos
5098,5,"This adapter is as small as it can possibly be, light weight and simple to use. It even comes with a very nice vinyl zipper case to protect your clothes from getting snagged by the various levers. The directions are clear, but it is well-marked and very intuitive, so they were virtually unnecessary. And ‚Äî the price is right. Just FYI, if you are including Italy in your trip, you will need a separate adapter. Italy does not use the same electric plugs as the rest of the EU. ",37,707,pos
5099,2,"Not totally opearable in Paris. It charged our phones, but electrical plug did not work for one second.",37,708,neg
5100,1,I bought it for Europe and it did not work in France. I needed it to recharge my phone and it would not work.,37,709,neg
5101,1,I bought this adapter in advance for my trip to Europe. I tried it in every hotel I stayed at during my 11 day tour (4 hotels). It didn‚Äôt work. It was too late to send back so I‚Äôm stuck with it AND I had to buy a new one in Europe. I do not recommend this product. ,37,710,neg
5102,5,"We purchased this unit for a trip to Israel. We used it to charge I-phones, camera batteries, and power a curling iron. Being able to charge multiple devices at one time was perfect and saved time. Previous reviews were helpful.",38,800,pos
5103,1,"Attempted to use this voltage converter in hotel room in Jakarta, Indonesia. Within 10 seconds of turning it on, it made a popping noise, sparked, and emitted a puff of smoke. The power button no longer functioned (stuck ON) and the two plug outlets did not work. The 4 USB ports did still work. Am returning defective item for a refund",38,801,neg
5104,1,"This product only supports devices that they do not need convertor. Before purchasing this, first read the label of your device. Almost all the devices listed here, originally support both voltage (110 and 220). ",38,802,pos
5105,5,"I bought this in preparation for a vacation to a few European countries, and found it to be terrific -- it's reliable and I felt that it was safely down-stepping the higher voltage for my US products. As the product description states, this is not for stuff like hair dryers or electric irons -- but for my family's electronic devices (including chargin batteries for an older, high-end digital camera) it was superb. It weighs very little and is easy to re-pack and toss into a backpack. We were all VERY happy with this purchase.",38,803,pos
5106,1,"I‚Äôm not an EE, but something is clearly wrong with this device. It works but seems like the ground has AC voltage on it. When charging a MacBook Pro, the laptop‚Äôs aluminum case has a subtle pulsing ‚Äúvibration‚Äù when you touch it. Did not seem to damage the laptop, but felt unsafe. Also, how did they get the tiny fan in this device to make so much noise?! Can double as a white noise generator, which is nice if you want a white noise generator.",38,804,pos
5107,4,This converts/charges as described. The fan only gets noisy if it's been running a long time but I never thought it was excessive. We mostly used it to charge our phones and tablets. I did use it for my straightener without trouble because the power was within the right range. Be aware that this is not recommended. I only did it a time or two with a straightener that is a spare. Though Switzerland is not listed it does say continental Europe. You need a different adapter in Switzerland. They are easy to get though I'd buy in the US. Switzerland is very expensive. I've been to 3 parts of Italy with no problems.,38,805,pos
5108,5,"My sister-in-law and I went on a trip to Italy and even though she had plug adapters, she did not have a converter so we both used this. The USB ports were very handy to charge our phones and cameras, and I ran it all night for my CPAP machine with no problems. We were in Italy for 15 days, multiple hotels and sites, and it worked like a charm everywhere we went. The converter was not noisy as some have stated. The sound is like a small fan on low speed. We barely noticed it. I like having the bag to keep everything together, even though I only took the Italy attachments with me on this trip. The only thing I could not use with it was a hair dryer, but I got one here on Amazon that is dual-voltage and was only about $20, and can be used at home or traveling, so that was fine.",38,806,pos
5109,4,"This worked well overseas! Charged multiple devices at one time which was nice. It was a bit bulkier than I had hoped causing me to use more space than I wanted. It has a fan that constantly runs when turned on, I knew this beforehand from reading other reviews but could be an issue for some. It isn't too loud for me but definitely noticeable. Overall a good product.",38,807,pos
5110,3,"Not leaving for a while so can't test it but there are no instructions as to which plug goes to which country, kind of forcing you to take them all. Also the size of the unit looks smaller on the ad than reality. They did not a lie as they did put in the measurements, I just never looked at a ruler. But when you look at the unit in all its parts, unit itself, plugs, cord etc it all adds up to pretty good. SO it gets a harsh rating of 3 because they should have sent complete instructions and added a pic that shows it all together. Looks solid though.",38,808,pos
5111,1,This power converter shot off sparks when I plugged in USB cable for my cell phone and broker while I was overseas. Luckily for me another person let me use their power converter to charge my phone. Cheaply made.,38,809,neu
5112,5,"We travel a lot to Europe where AC voltages vary quite a bit... our equipment, hair dryer, phone charger, tablet charger, etc are all 110ac, so regulating the European outlets is a must... we've used it many times and fully trust this converter.. the warranty is like purchasing an extended warranty, but free... 18 months is pretty much unheard of, that says a lot for the quality of a purchase.. I would recommend to anyone and everyone if you need to regulate your AC power, this is the item to get! (and it comes with all the wall adaptors)... SO, now you can travel worry free‚Ä¶",38,810,pos
5113,5,"This was great when I was traveling for a month overseas. Love all the ports that it had. My mom, sister, and I could all charge our phones and my mom's smart watch at the same time. lucky I could use the same adapter connection in Canada, Japan, and the Philippines so I only took one outlet adapter with me. I was loud when you start it up. You can hear it while it is on, sounds like there is a little fan inside of it. My cousins in Japan tried to plug in their stuff into my adapter but it didn't have enough watt for their stuff. This was a great product, it is heavy but I carried it in my backpack the whole time.",38,811,pos
5114,5,"I just got back from a trip to Ireland and it worked perfectly! I liked how I could use the USB ports and plug in and use a curling iron at the same time. It has a small light that lets you know it is on and it was great as a night light! With so many country options, it is perfect for the world traveler. I highly recommend it.",39,900,pos
5115,5,"I bought this to travel to Europe with family, with 4 iPhones and other USB devices, I bought another cheaper adapter with 2 USB ports. But we all loved this one because it has 4 USB ports and charges quicker.",39,901,pos
5116,5,"I travel quite frequently to different countries, so the multiple adapter function is wonderful. I just bought this adapter before my Iceland trip and it was great! Worked perfectly. Did not giggle too much in the port. Never fell out. Charges my devices quickly, and met my expectations. When you unplug it there will continue to be a blue glow for about a minute. This is fine, as it is just the remaining current that will quit soon. Definitely recommend. I find it worth the money",39,902,pos
5117,3,"I was so excited to receive this product ahead of a business trip to the UK and Austria. Basically, it‚Äôs good for plugging into each outlet while using a USB cable to charge your phone, smart, watch, etc., but I have been unable to use the adapter for plugging my laptop cable in and charging its battery. Pretty bummed since I had to presentations to deliver and a dead battery. Had to borrow a co-workers plug to get through!",39,903,pos
5118,1,My first trip out of the U.S. and. My new ( Christmas present ) Unidapt adapter refuses to charge my camera battery or anything else. I ended up using my friends converter and it did the job perfectly . I tried the U K outlets. Very disappointed. The other reviews tell a different story. I‚Äôll get back to you and see how the company warranty works .,39,904,neu
5119,5,This is best thing I took with me to Great Britain. Worked in every hotel from Scotland to Cardiff and did the job great.,39,905,pos
5120,1,"I really hate to give such a low review since the adapter seemed to be fantastic out of the box. Unfortunately, when I landed in Austria, the spring-loaded fuse door won't stay closed which is a pain to deal with. It could be a simple manufacturing random error, but as for MY experience, I was not happy to get to another country and have to immediately go out and buy an adapter when I thought I had been prepared.",39,906,neg
5121,5,Perfect for my UK pot that needed a additional plug. Ez to figure out. Has a light that come on to show it works. As u see in pix they have this black button that opposite of the switches that pushes in when u want to switch push in or push back that specific outlet. Just tried it perfect that i got a second one. Enjoy,39,907,pos
5122,4,"Get it for when you travel! This was great for me that I went to several different countries in one trip and it worked for all of the countries. My flaws for this is that all of the USB ports don‚Äôt work. This is a pretty large product so beware, but it‚Äôs a good and solid product.",39,908,neu
5123,1,I went to Scotland and on the first usage this completely stopped working. It was also hard to move the different adapters in and out,39,909,neg
5124,5,"Although I won't actually be using it until next week, the adapter appears to be sturdy and very convenient to use. I ordered one of the brighter colors (blue) so it will be easy to locate in my luggage (rather than black like most electronics).",39,910,pos
5125,5,"This item is perfectly compact because you don‚Äôt need several separate international plugs (as my other units were). This takes the guess work out. I Traveled to South Africa recently and it was great! I simply inserted my usb cords into this product, slid out appropriate plug for that country, and inserted it into hotel outlet. There‚Äôs a UK, EU, etc. It worked without any issues. Throw away all those separate pieces of other adapters and just use this ONE!",40,1000,pos
5126,5,"This is a charger adapter plug for those who travel out of the country. However, as a added feature, it does include American outlets for charging your devices as well. One thing I really like is the ability ti charge more than one device on this plug as well. I dropped it kinda hard roo and it did not break. So, even if you are clumsy, this plug is a good choice.",40,1001,pos
5127,5,"For what you might pay for a cheaper made power adapter, you can get this much better made and more feature rich travel adapter. The USB ports work very well (I have charged three items at once). I have used this adapater in both AU and EU modes and have had no issues.",40,1002,pos
5128,5,No one can have too many adapters - I can be forgetful and get to a foreign country with no way to juice up my iphone and ipad. What I like about this converter is that it has 4 USB also has the ability to plug in any USB devices. The back has pop up prongs for the different converter types. It has a high quality build and is very solid and durable. Love the travel case also,40,1003,pos
5129,5,I travel internationally (US based) for work and pleasure. This will certainly come in handy for my upcoming trips!,40,1004,pos

5131,4,"Would be 5 stars but had to be very careful with how you plugged this in to the wall. Sometimes it wouldn't even stay in so i would need to find a different outlet. Other than that, i was able to charge 4 phones and a tablet at the same time without issue.",40,1006,neu
5132,4,Good product,40,1007,pos
5133,4,"I bought this for an upcoming trip to Ireland. I like the versatility of being able to use it in other countries as well.
